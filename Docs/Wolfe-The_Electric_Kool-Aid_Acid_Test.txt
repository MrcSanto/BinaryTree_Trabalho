   That's good thinking there, cool breeze, cool breeze is a kid with three
   or four days' beard sitting next to me on the stamped metal bottom of the
   open back part of a pickup truck. Bouncing along. Dipping and rising and
   rolling on these rotten springs like a boat. Out the back of the truck the
   city of San Francisco is bouncing down the hill, all those endless
   staggers of bay windows, slums with a view, bouncing and streaming down
   the hill. One after another, electric signs with neon martini glasses lit
   up on them, the San Francisco symbol of "bar"-thousands of neon-magenta
   martini glasses bouncing and streaming down the hill, and beneath them
   hundreds, thousands of people wheeling around to look at this freaking
   crazed truck we're in, their white faces erupting from their lapels like
   marshmallows-streaming and bouncing down the hill-and God knows they've
   got plenty to look at.

   That's why it strikes me as funny when Cool Breeze says very seriously
   over the whole roar of the thing, "I don't know-when Kesey gets out I
   don't know if I can come around the Warehouse."

   "Why not?"

   "Well, like the cops are going to be coming around like all feisty, and
   I'm on probation, so I don't know."

   Well, that's good thinking there, Cool Breeze. Don't rouse the bastids.
   Lie low-like right now. Right now Cool Breeze is so terrified of the law
   he is sitting up in plain view of thousands of already startled citizens
   wearing some kind of Seven Dwarfs Black Forest gnome's hat covered in
   feathers and fluorescent colors. Kneeling in the truck, facing us, also in
   plain view, is a half-Ottawa Indian girl named Lois Jennings, with her
   head thrown back and a radiant look on her face. Also a blazing silver
   disk in the middle of her forehead alternately exploding with light when
   the sun hits it or sending off rainbows from the defraction lines in it.
   And, oh yeah, there's a long-barreled Colt .45 revolver in her hand, only
   nobody on the street can tell it's a cap pistol as she pegs away, kheeew,
   kheeew, at the erupting marshmallow faces like Debra Paget in ... in ...

   -Kesey's coming out of jail!

   Two more things they are looking at out there are a sign on the rear
   bumper reading "Custer Died for Your Sins" and, at the wheel, Lois's
   enamorado Stewart Brand, a thin blond guy with a blazing disk on his
   forehead too, and a whole necktie made of Indian beads. No shirt, however,
   just an Indian bead necktie on bare skin and a white butcher's coat with
   medals from the King of Sweden on it.

   Here comes a beautiful one, attache case and all, the day-is-done
   resentful look and the ... shoes-how they shine!-and what the hell are
   these beatnik ninnies-and Lois plugs him in the old marshmallow and he
   goes streaming and bouncing down the hill...

   And the truck heaves and billows, blazing silver red and Day-Glo, and I
   doubt seriously, Cool Breeze, that there is a single cop in all of San
   Francisco today who does not know that this crazed vehicle is a guerrilla
   patrol from the dread LSD.

   The cops now know the whole scene, even the costumes, the jesuschrist
   strung-out hair, Indian beads, Indian headbands, donkey beads, temple
   bells, amulets, mandalas, god's-eyes, fluorescent vests, unicorn horns,
   Errol Flynn dueling shirts-but they still don't know about the shoes. The
   heads have a thing about shoes. The worst are shiny black shoes with
   shoelaces in them. The hierarchy ascends from there, although practically
   all lowcut shoes are unhip, from there on up to the boots the heads like,
   light, fanciful boots, English boots of the mod variety, if that is all
   they can get, but better something like hand-tooled Mexican boots with
   Caliente Dude Triple A toes on them. So see the FBI-black-shiny-laced
   up-FBI shoes-when the FBI finally grabbed Kesey-

   There is another girl in the back of the truck, a dark little girl with
   thick black hair, called Black Maria. She looks Mexican, but she says to
   me in straight soft Californian:

   "When is your birthday?"

   "March 2."

   "Pisces," she says. And then: "I would never take you for a Pisces."

   "Why?"

   "You seem too... solid for a Pisces."

   But I know she means stolid. I am beginning to feel stolid. Back in New
   York City, Black Maria, I tell you, I am even known as something of a
   dude. But somehow a blue silk blazer and a big tie with clowns on it and
   ... a ... pair of shiny lowcut black shoes don't set them all to doing the
   Varsity Rag in the head world in San Francisco. Lois picks off the
   marshmallows one by one; Cool Breeze ascends into the innards of his
   gnome's hat; Black Maria, a Scorpio herself, rummages through the Zodiac;
   Stewart Brand winds it through the streets; paillettes explode-and this is
   nothing special, just the usual, the usual in the head world of San
   Francisco, just a little routine messing up the minds of the citizenry en
   route, nothing more than psyche food for beautiful people, while giving
   some guy from New York a lift to the Warehouse to wait for the Chief, Ken
   Kesey, who is getting out of jail.

   ABOUT ALL I KNEW ABOUT KESEY AT THAT POINT WAS THAT HE was a highly
   regarded 31-year-old novelist and in a lot of trouble over drugs. He wrote
   One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1962), which was made into a play in
   1963, and Sometimes a Great Notion (1964). He was always included with
   Philip Roth and Joseph Heller and Bruce Jay Friedman and a couple of
   others as one of the young novelists who might go all the way. Then he was
   arrested twice for possession of marijuana, in April of 1965 and January
   of 1966, and fled to Mexico rather than risk a stiff sentence. It looked
   like as much as five years, as a second offender. One day I happened to
   get hold of some letters Kesey wrote from Mexico to his friend Larry
   McMurtry, who wrote Horseman, Pass By, from which the movie Hud was made.
   They were wild and ironic, written like a cross between William Burroughs
   and George Ade, telling of hideouts, disguises, paranoia, fleeing from
   cops, smoking joints and seeking satori in the Rat lands of Mexico. There
   was one passage written George Ade-fashion in the third person as a parody
   of what the straight world back there in the U.S.A. must think of him now:

   "In short, this young, handsome, successful,
   happily-married-three-lovely-children father was a fear-crazed dope fiend
   in flight to avoid prosecution on three felonies and god knows how many
   misdemeanors and seeking at the same time to sculpt a new satori from an
   old surf-in even shorter, mad as a hatter.

   "Once an athlete so valued he had been given the job of calling signals
   from the line and risen into contention for the nationwide amateur
   wrestling crown, now he didn't know if he could do a dozen pushups. Once
   possessor of a phenomenal bank account and money waving from every hand,
   now it was all his poor wife could do to scrape together eight dollars to
   send as getaway money to Mexico. But a few years previous he had been
   listed in Who's Who and asked to speak at such auspicious gatherings as
   the Wellesley Club in Dah-la and now they wouldn't even allow him to speak
   at a VDC [Vietnam Day Committee] gathering. What was it that had brought a
   man so high of promise to so low a state in so short a time? Well, the
   answer can be found in just one short word, my friends, in just one
   all-well-used syllable:

   "Dope!

   "And while it may be claimed by some of the addled advocates of these
   chemicals that our hero is known to have indulged in drugs before his
   literary success, we must point out that there was evidence of his
   literary prowess well before the advent of the so-called psychedelic into
   his life but no evidence at all of any of the lunatic thinking that we
   find thereafter ! "

   To which he added:

   "(oh yea, the wind hums

   time ago-time ago-

   the rafter drums and the walls see

   ... and there's a door to that bird

   in the sa-a-a-apling sky

   time ago by-

   Oh yeah the surf giggles

   time ago time ago

   of under things killed when

   bad was banished and all the

   doors to the birds vanished

   time ago then.)"

   I got the idea of going to Mexico and trying to find him and do a story on
   Young Novelist Real-Life Fugitive. I started asking around about where he
   might be in Mexico. Everybody on the hip circuit in New York knew for
   certain. It seemed to be the thing to know this summer. He is in Puerto
   Vallarta. He is in Ajijic. He is in Oaxaca. He is in San Miguel de
   Allende. He is in Paraguay. He just took a steamboat from Mexico to
   Canada. And everyone knew for certain.

   I was still asking around when Kesey sneaked back into the U.S. in October
   and the FBI caught up with him on the Bayshore freeway south of San
   Francisco. An agent chased him down an embankment and caught him and Kesey
   was in jail. So I flew to San Francisco. I went straight to the San Mateo
   County jail in Redwood City and the scene in the waiting room there was
   more like the stage door at the Music Box Theatre. It was full of cheerful
   anticipation. There was a young psychologist there, Jim Fadiman-Clifton
   Fadiman's nephew, it turned out-and Jim and his wife Dorothy were happily
   stuffing three I Ching coins into the spine of some interminable dense
   volume of Oriental mysticism and they asked me to get word to Kesey that
   the coins were in there. There was also a little roundfaced brunette named
   Marilyn who told me she used to be a teenie grouper hanging out with a
   rock 'n' roll group called The Wild Flowers but now she was mainly with
   Bobby Petersen. Bobby Petersen was not a musician. He was a saint, as
   nearly as I could make out. He was in jail down in Santa Cruz trying to
   fight a marijuana charge on the grounds that marijuana was a religious
   sacrament for him. I didn't figure out exactly why she was up here in the
   San Mateo jail waiting room instead except that it was like a stage door,
   as I said, with Kesey as the star who was still inside.

   There was a slight hassle with the jailers over whether I was to get in to
   see him or not. The cops had nothing particularly to gain by letting me
   in. A reporter from New York-that just meant more publicity for this
   glorified beatnik. That was the line on Kesey. He was a glorified beatnik
   up on two dope charges, and why make a hero out of him. I must say that
   California has smooth cops. They all seem to be young, tall, crewcut,
   blond, with bleached blue eyes, like they just stepped out of a cigarette
   ad. Their jailhouses don't look like jailhouses, at least not the

   parts the public sees. They are all blond wood, fluorescent lights and
   filing-cabinet-tan metal, like the Civil Service exam room in a new Post
   Office building. The cops all speak soft Californian and are neat and
   correct as an ice cube. By the book; so they finally let me in to see
   Kesey during visiting hours. I had ten minutes. I waved goodbye to Marilyn
   and the Fadimans and the jolly scene downstairs and they took me up to the
   third floor in an elevator.

   The elevator opened right onto a small visiting room. It was weird. Here
   was a lineup of four or five cubicles, like the isolation booths on the
   old TV quiz shows, each one with a thick plate-glass window and behind
   each window a prisoner in a prison blue workshirt. They were lined up like
   haddocks on ice. Outside each window ran a counter with a telephone on it.
   That's what you speak over in here. A couple of visitors are already
   hunched over the things. Then I pick out Kesey.

   He is standing up with his arms folded over his chest and his eyes focused
   in the distance, i.e., the wall. He has thick wrists and big forearms, and
   the way he has them folded makes them look gigantic. He looks taller than
   he really is, maybe because of his neck. He has a big neck with a pair of
   sternocleido-mastoid muscles that rise up out of the prison workshirt like
   a couple of dock ropes. His jaw and chin are massive. He looks a little
   like Paul Newman, except that he is more muscular, has thicker skin, and
   he has tight blond curls boiling up around his head. His hair is almost
   gone on top, but somehow that goes all right with his big neck and general
   wrestler's build. Then he smiles slightly. It's curious, he doesn't have a
   line in his face. After all the chasing and hassling-he looks like the
   third week at the Sauna Spa; serene, as I say.

   Then I pick up my telephone and he picks up his-and this is truly Modern
   Times. We are all of twenty-four inches apart, but there is a piece of
   plate glass as thick as a telephone directory between us. We might as well
   be in different continents, talking over Videophone. The telephones are
   very crackly and lo-fi, especially considering that they have a world of
   two feet to span. Naturally it was assumed that the police monitored every
   conversation. I wanted to ask him all about his fugitive days in Mexico.
   That was still the name of my story, Young Novelist Fugitive Eight Months
   in Mexico. But he could hardly go into that on this weird hookup, and
   besides, I had only ten minutes. I take out a notebook and start asking
   him-anything. There had been a piece in the paper about his saying it was
   time for the psychedelic movement to go "beyond acid," so I asked him
   about that. Then I started scribbling like mad, in shorthand, in the
   notebook. I could see his lips moving two feet away. His voice crackled
   over the telephone like it was coming from Brisbane. The whole thing was
   crazy. It seemed like calisthenics we were going through.

   "It's my idea," he said, "that it's time to graduate from what has been
   going on, to something else. The psychedelic wave was happening six or
   eight months ago when I went to Mexico. It's been growing since then, but
   it hasn't been moving. I saw the same stuff when I got back as when I
   left. It was just bigger, that was all-" He talks in a soft voice with a
   country accent, almost a pure country accent, only crackling and rasping
   and cheese-grated over the two-foot hookup, talking about-

   "-there's been no creativity," he is saying, "and I think my value has
   been to help create the next step. I don't think there will be any
   movement off the drug scene until there is something else to move to-"

   -all in a plain country accent about something-well, to be frank, I didn't
   know what in the hell it was all about. Sometimes he spoke cryptically, in
   aphorisms. I told him I had heard he didn't intend to do any more writing.
   Why? I said.

   "I'd rather be a lightning rod than a seismograph," he said.

   He talked about something called the Acid Test and forms of expression in
   which there would be no separation between himself and the audience. It
   would be all one experience, with all the senses opened wide, words,
   music, lights, sounds, touch-lightning.

   "You mean on the order of what Andy Warhol is doing?" I said.

   ... pause. "No offense," says Kesey, "but New York is about two years
   behind."

   He said it very patiently, with a kind of country politeness, as if... I
   don't want to be rude to you fellows from the City, but there's been
   things going on out here that you would never guess in your wildest
   million years, old buddy ...

   THE TEN MINUTES WERE UP AND I WAS OUT OF THERE. I HAD gotten nothing,
   except my first brush with a strange phenomenon, that strange up-country
   charisma, the Kesey presence. I had nothing to do but kill time and hope
   Kesey would get out on bail somehow and I could talk to him and get the
   details on Novelist Fugitive in Mexico. This seemed like a very long shot
   at this time, because Kesey had two marijuana charges against him and had
   already jumped the country once.

   So I rented a car and started making the rounds in San Francisco. Somehow
   my strongest memories of San Francisco are of me in a terrific rented
   sedan roaring up hills or down hills, sliding on and off the cable-car
   tracks. Slipping and sliding down to North Beach, the fabled North Beach,
   the old fatherland bohemia of the West Coast, always full of Big Daddy
   So-and-so and Costee Plusee and long-haired little Wasp and Jewish buds
   balling spade cats-and now North Beach was dying. North Beach was nothing
   but tit shows. In the famous Beat Generation HQ, the City Lights
   bookstore, Shig Murao, the Nipponese panjandrum of the place, sat
   glowering with his beard hanging down like those strands of furze and fern
   in an architect's drawing, drooping over the volumes of Kahlil Gibran by
   the cash register while Professional Budget Finance Dentists here for the
   convention browsed in search of the beatniks between tit shows. Everything
   was The Topless on North Beach, strippers with their breasts enlarged with
   injections of silicone emulsion.

   The action-meaning the hip cliques that set the original tone-the action
   was all over in Haight-Ashbury. Pretty soon all the bellwethers of a
   successful bohemia would be there, too, the cars going through, bumper to
   bumper, with everbody rubbernecking, the tour buses going through "and
   here ... Home of the Hippies... there's one there," and the queers and
   spade hookers and bookstores and boutiques. Everything was Haight-Ashbury
   and the acid heads.

   But it was not just North Beach that was dying. The whole old-style hip
   life-jazz, coffee houses, civil rights, invite a spade for dinner,
   Vietnam-it was all suddenly dying, I found out, even among the students at
   Berkeley, across the bay from San Francisco, which had been the heart of
   the "student-rebellion" and so forth. It had even gotten to the point that
   Negroes were no longer in the hip scene, not even as totem figures. It was
   unbelievable. Spades, the very soul figures of Hip, of jazz, of the hip
   vocabulary itself, man and like and dig and baby and scarf and split and
   later and so fine, of civil rights and graduating from Reed College and
   living on North Beach, down Mason, and balling spade cats-all that good
   elaborate petting and patting and pouring soul all over the spades-all
   over, finished, incredibly.

   So I was starting to get the trend of all this heaving and convulsing in
   the bohemian world of San Francisco. Meantime, miraculously, Kesey's three
   young lawyers, Pat Hallinan, Brian Rohan, and Paul Robertson, were about
   to get Kesey out on bail. They assured the judges, in San Mateo and San
   Francisco, that Mr. Kesey had a very public-spirited project in mind. He
   had returned from exile for the express purpose of calling a huge meeting
   of heads and hippies at Winterland Arena in San Francisco in order to tell
   The Youth to stop taking LSD because it was dangerous and might french fry
   their brains, etc. It was going to be an "acid graduation" ceremony. They
   should go "beyond acid." That was what Kesey had been talking to me about,
   I guess. At the same time, six of Kesey's close friends in the Palo Alto
   area had put their homes up as security for a total of $35,000 bail with
   the San Mateo County court. I suppose the courts figured they had Kesey
   either way. If he jumped bail now, it would be such a dirty trick on his
   friends, costing them their homes, that Kesey would be discredited as a
   drug apostle or anything else. If he didn't, he would be obliged to give
   his talk to The Youth-and so much the better. In any case, Kesey was
   coming out.

   This script was not very popular in Haight-Ashbury, however. I soon found
   out that the head life in San Francisco was already such a big thing that
   Kesey's return and his acid graduation plan were causing the heads' first
   big political crisis. All eyes were on Kesey and his group, known as the
   Merry Pranksters. Thousands of kids were moving into San Francisco for a
   life based on LSD and the psychedelic thing. Thing was the major abstract
   word in Haight-Ashbury. It could mean anything, isms, life styles, habits,
   leanings, causes, sexual organs; thing and freak; freak referred to styles
   and obsessions, as in "Stewart Brand is an Indian freak" or "the
   zodiac-that's her freak," or just to heads in costume. It wasn't a
   negative word. Anyway, just a couple of weeks before, the heads had held
   their first big "be-in" in Golden Gate Park, at the foot of the hill
   leading up into Haight-Ashbury, in mock observance of the day LSD became
   illegal in California. This was a gathering of all the tribes, all the
   communal groups. All the freaks came and did their thing. A head named
   Michael Bowen started it, and thousands of them piled in, in high costume,
   ringing bells, chanting, dancing ecstatically, blowing their minds one way
   and another and making their favorite satiric gestures to the cops,
   handing them flowers, burying the bastids in tender fruity petals of love.
   Oh christ, Tom, the thing was fantastic, a freaking mind-blower, thousands
   of high-loving heads out there messing up the minds of the cops and
   everybody else in a fiesta of love and euphoria. Even Kesey, who was still
   on the run then, had brazened on in and mingled with the crowd for a
   while, and they were all one, even Kesey-and now all of a sudden here he
   is, in the hands of the FBI and other supercops, the biggest name in The
   Life, Kesey, announcing that it is time to "graduate from acid." And what
   the hell is this, a copout or what? The Stop Kesey movement was beginning
   even within the hip world.

   We pull up to the Warehouse in the crazed truck and-well, for a start, I
   begin to see that people like Lois and Stewart and Black Maria are the
   restrained, reflective wing of the Merry Pranksters. The Warehouse is on
   Harriet Street, between Howard and Folsom. Like most of San Francisco,
   Harriet Street is a lot of wooden buildings with bay windows all painted
   white. But Harriet Street is in San Francisco's Skid Row area, and despite
   all the paint, it looks like about forty winos crawled off in the shadows
   and died and turned black and bloated and exploded, sending forth a stream
   of spirochetes that got into every board, every strip, every crack, every
   splinter, every flecking flake of paint. The Warehouse actually turns out
   to be the ground-floor garage of an abandoned hotel. Its last commercial
   use was as a pie factory. We pull up to the garage and there is a panel
   truck parked just outside, painted in blue, yellow, orange, red Day-Glo,
   with the word BAM in huge letters on the hood. From out the black hole of
   the garage comes the sound of a record by Bob Dylan with his raunchy
   harmonica and Ernest Tubb voice raunching and rheuming in the old
   jack-legged chants-

   Inside is a huge chaotic space with what looks at first in the gloom like
   ten or fifteen American flags walking around. This turns out to be a bunch
   of men and women, most of them in their twenties, in white coveralls of
   the sort airport workers wear, only with sections of American flags sewn
   all over, mostly the stars against fields of blue but some with red
   stripes running down the legs. Around the side is a lot of theater
   scaffolding with blankets strewn across like curtains and whole rows of
   uprooted theater seats piled up against the walls and big cubes of metal
   debris and ropes and girders.

   One of the blanket curtains edges back and a little figure vaults down
   from a platform about nine feet up. It glows. It is a guy about five feet
   tall with some sort of World War I aviator's helmet on ... glowing with
   curves and swirls of green and orange. His boots, too; he seems to be
   bouncing over on a pair of fluorescent globes. He stops. He has a small,
   fine, ascetic face with a big mustache and huge eyes. The eyes narrow and
   he breaks into a grin.

   "I just had an eight-year-old boy up there," he says.

   Then he goes into a sniffling giggle and bounds, glowing, over into a
   corner, in among the debris.

   Everybody laughs. It is some kind of family joke, I guess. At least I am
   the only one who scans the scaffolding for the remains.

   "That's the Hermit." Three days later I see he has built a cave in the
   corner.

   A bigger glow in the center of the garage. I make out a school bus.. .
   glowing orange, green, magenta, lavender, chlorine blue, every fluorescent
   pastel imaginable in thousands of designs, both large and small, like a
   cross between Fernand Leger and Dr. Strange, roaring together and
   vibrating off each other as if somebody had given Hieronymous Bosch fifty
   buckets of Day-Glo paint and a 1939 International Harvester school bus and
   told him to go to it. On the floor by the bus is a 15-foot banner reading
   ACID TEST GRADUATION, and two or three of the Flag People are working on
   it. Bob Dylan's voice is raunching and rheuming and people are moving
   around, and babies are crying. I don't see them but they are somewhere in
   here, crying. Off to one side is a guy about 40 with a lot of muscles, as
   you can see because he has no shirt on-just a pair of khakis and some red
   leather boots on and his hell of a build-and he seems to be in a kinetic
   trance, flipping a small sledge hammer up in the air over and over, always
   managing to catch the handle on the way down with his arms and legs
   kicking out the whole time and his shoulders rolling and his head bobbing,
   all in a jerky beat as if somewhere Joe Cuba is playing "Bang Bang"
   although in fact even Bob Dylan is no longer on and out of the speaker,
   wherever it is, comes some sort of tape with a spectral voice saying:

   "... The Nowhere Mine ... we've got bubble-gum wrappers ..." some sort of
   weird electronic music behind it, with Oriental intervals, like Juan
   Carrillo's music: "... We're going to jerk it out from under the world ...
   working in the Nowhere Mine ... this day, every day ..."

   One of the Flag People comes up.

   "Hey, Mountain Girl! That's wild!"

   Mountain Girl is a tall girl, big and beautiful with dark brown hair
   falling down to her shoulders except that the lower two-thirds of her
   falling hair looks like a paint brush dipped in cadmium yellow from where
   she dyed it blond in Mexico. She pivots and shows the circle of stars on
   the back of her coveralls.

   "We got 'em at a uniform store," she says. "Aren't they great! There's
   this old guy in there, says, 'Now, you ain't gonna cut them flags up for
   costumes, are you?' And so I told him, 'Naw, we're gonna git some horns
   and have a parade.' But you see this? This is really why we got 'em."

   She points to a button on the coveralls. Everybody leans in to look. A
   motto is engraved on the bottom in art nouveau curves: "Can't Bust 'Em."

   Can't Bust 'Em!... and about time. After all the times the Pranksters have
   gotten busted, by the San Mateo County cops, the San Francisco cops, the
   Mexicale Federale cops, FBI cops, cops cops cops cops...

   And still the babies cry. Mountain Girl turns to Lois Jennings.

   "What do Indians do to stop a baby from crying?"

   "They hold its nose."

   "Yeah?"

   "They learn."

   "I'll try it... it sounds logical . . ." And Mountain Girl goes over and
   picks up her baby, a four-month-old girl named Sunshine, out of one of
   those tube-and-net portable cribs from behind the bus and sits down in one
   of the theater seats. But instead of the Indian treatment she unbuttons
   the Can't Bust 'Em coveralls and starts feeding her.

   "... The Nowhere Mine ... Nothing felt and screamed and cried . . ." brang
   tweeeeeeng ". . . and I went back to the Nowhere Mine ..."

   The sledge-hammer juggler rockets away-

   "Who is that?"

   "That's Cassady."

   This strikes me as a marvelous fact. I remember Cassady. Cassady, Neal
   Cassady, was the hero, "Dean Moriarty," of Jack Kerouac's On the Road, the
   Denver Kid, a kid who was always racing back and forth across the U.S. by
   car, chasing, or outrunning, "life," and here is the same guy, now 40, in
   the garage, flipping a sledge hammer, rocketing about to his own Joe Cuba
   and-talking. Cassady never stops talking. But that is a bad way to put it.
   Cassady is a monologuist, only he doesn't seem to care whether anyone is
   listening or not. He just goes off on the monologue, by himself if
   necessary, although anyone is welcome aboard. He will answer all
   questions, although not exactly in that order, because we can't stop here,
   next rest area 40 miles, you understand, spinning off memories, metaphors,
   literary, Oriental, hip allusions, all punctuated by the unlikely
   expression, "you understand-"

                                    Chapter

                                       II

                               The Bladder Totem

   FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS IT WENT LIKE THAT FOR ME IN THE garage with the
   Merry Pranksters waiting for Kesey. The Pranksters took me pretty much for
   granted. One of the Flag People, a blonde who looked like Doris Day but
   was known as Doris Delay, told me I ought to put some more ... well,
   color... into my appearance. That hurt, Doris Delay, but I know you meant
   it as a kindly suggestion. She really did. So I kept my necktie on to show
   that I had pride. But nobody gave a damn about that. I just hung around
   and Cassady flipped his sledge hammer, spectral tapes played, babies
   cried, mihs got flipped out, bus glowed, Flag People walk, freaks loop in
   outta sunlight on old Harriet Street, and I only left to sleep for a few
   hours or go to the bathroom.

   The bathroom; yes. There was no plumbing in the Warehouse, not even any
   cold water. You could go out into a little vacant lot next door, behind a
   board fence, and take a stance amid the great fluffy fumes of human piss
   that were already lufting up from the mud, or you could climb a ladder
   through a trap door that led up to the old hotel where there were dead
   flophouse halls lined with rooms of a kind of spongy scabid old wood that
   broke apart under your glance and started crawling, vermin, molting
   underlife. It was too rank even for the Pranksters. Most of them went up
   to the Shell station on the corner. So I went up to the Shell station on
   the corner, at Sixth and Howard. I asked where the bathroom is and the guy
   gives me The Look-the rotten look of O.K., you're not even buying gas but
   you want to use the bathroom-and finally he points inside the office to
   the tin can. The key to the bathroom is chained to a big empty Shell oil
   can. I pick it up and walk out of the office part, out onto the concrete
   apron, where the Credit Card elite are tanking up and stretching their
   legs and tweezing their undershorts out of the aging waxy folds of their
   scrota, and I am out there carrying a Shell oil can in both hands like a
   bladder totem, around the corner, to the toilet, and-all right, so what.
   But suddenly it hits me that for the Pranksters this is permanent. This is
   the way they live. Men, women, boys, girls, most from middle-class
   upbringings, men and women and boys and girls and children and babies,
   this is the way they have been living for months, for years, some of them,
   across America and back, on the bus, down to the Rat lands of Mexico and
   back, sailing like gypsies along the Servicenter fringes, copping
   urinations, fencing with rotten looks-it even turns out they have films
   and tapes of their duels with service-station managers in the American
   heartland trying to keep their concrete bathrooms and empty
   Dispensa-Towels safe from the Day-Glo crazies...

   Back inside the Warehouse. Everything keeps up. Slowly I am getting more
   and more of a strange feeling about the whole thing. It is not just the
   costumes, the tapes, the bus and all that, however. I have been through
   some crewcut college fraternity weekends that have been weirder-looking
   and -sounding, insane on the beano. The ... feeling begins when the Flag
   People start coming up to me and saying things like-well, when Cassady is
   flipping the sledge hammer, with his head down in the mull of the
   universe, just mulling the hell out of it, and blam, the sledge hammer, he
   misses it, and it slams onto the concrete floor of the garage and one of
   the Flag People says, "You know, the Chief says when Cassady misses it,
   it's never an accident-"

   For a start, the term the "Chief." The Pranksters have two terms for
   referring to Kesey. If it is some mundane matter they're talking about,
   it's just Kesey, as in "Kesey got a tooth knocked out." But if they are
   talking about Kesey as the leader or teacher of the whole group, he
   becomes the Chief. At first this struck me as phony. But then it turned
   to... mysto, as the general mysto steam began rising in my head. This
   steam, I can actually hear it inside my head, a great ssssssssss, like
   what you hear if you take too much quinine. I don't know if this happens
   to anybody else or not. But if there is something startling enough,
   fearful, awesome, strange, or just weird enough, something I sense I can't
   cope with, it is as if I go on Red Alert and the fogging steam starts . .
   .

   "-when Cassady misses, it's never an accident. He's saying something.
   There's something going on in the room, something's getting up tight,
   there's bad vibrations and he wants to break it up.

   They mean it. Everything in everybody's life is... significant. And
   everybody is alert, watching for the meanings. And the vibrations. There
   is no end of vibrations. Sometime after that I was up in Haight-Ashbury
   with some kid, not a Prankster, a kid from another communal group, and the
   kid was trying to open an old secretaire, the kind that opens out into a
   desktop you can write on, and he pinches his finger in a hinge. Only
   instead of saying Aw shit or whatever, the whole thing becomes a parable
   of life, and he says:

   "That's typical. You see that? Even the poor cat who designed this thing
   was playing the game they wanted him to play. You see how this thing is
   designed, to open out? It's always out, into, it's got to be out, into
   your life, the old bullshit thrust-you know?-they don't even think about
   it-you know?-this is just the way they design things and you're here and
   they're there and they're going to keep coming at you. You see that
   kitchen table?" There is an old enamel-top kitchen table you can see
   through a doorway in there. "Now that's actually better design, it
   actually is, than all this ornate shit, I mean, I truly dig that kitchen
   table, because the whole thing is right there-you know?-it's there to
   receive, that's what it's all about, it's passive, I mean what the hell is
   a table anyway? Freud said a table is a symbol of a woman, with her shanks
   open, balling it, in dreams-you know?-and what is this a symbol of? " He
   points to the secretaire. "It's a symbol of fuck-you, Fuck you, right?"
   And so on, until I want to put my hand on his shoulder and say why don't
   you just kick it in the kneecaps and let it go at that.

   But anyway this talk just flows. Everyone is picking up on the most minute
   incidents as if they are metaphors for life itself. Everybody's life
   becomes more fabulous, every minute, than the most fabulous book. It's
   phony, goddamn it. .. but mysto ... and after a while it starts to infect
   you, like an itch, the roseola.

   There is also a lot about games. The straight world outside, it seems, is
   made up of millions of people involved, trapped, in games they aren't even
   aware of. A guy they call Hassler comes in out of the sunlight screen on
   Harriet Street and, zoom, he doesn't even wait for the metaphors. I never
   got into an abstract discussion with a total stranger so fast in my life.
   We began talking right away about the games. Hassler is a young guy,
   good-looking with a wide face and long hair with bangs just exactly like
   Prince Valiant in the comic strip and a turtleneck jersey on with metal
   stars on it, of the sort generals wear on their shoulders, and he says,
   "Games so permeate our culture that..." rumble rumble ego games judge
   everything screwed up brainwashing tell ourselves "... keep on
   oppositioning"-here Hassler stiffens his hands and brings his fingertips
   together like a karate collision-

   But my mind is wandering. I am having a hard time listening because I am
   fascinated by a little plastic case with a toothbrush and toothpaste in it
   that Hassler has tucked under one thumb. It is shuddering around in front
   of my eyes as Hassler's hands opposition ... What a curious bunch of
   bohos. This guy with the generals' stars on his jersey is giving a kind of
   vesper service lecture on the sins of man and-a toothbrush!-but of
   course!-he brushes after every meal!-he really does. He brushes after
   every meal despite the fact that they are living here in this garage, like
   gypsies, and there is no hot water, no toilet, no beds, except for a
   couple of mattresses in which the dirt, the dust, the damps, and the scuds
   are all one, melded, with the stuffing, and they stretch out on the
   scaffoldings, in the bus, in the back of a pickup truck, nostrils
   mildewing-

   "-but you know what? People are beginning to see through the warf of the
   games. Not just the heads and everybody, but all sorts of people. You take
   in California. There's always been this pyramid-"

   Here Hassler outlines a pyramid in the air with his hands and I watch,
   fascinated, as the plastic toothbrush case shiny shiny slides up one
   incline of the pyramid-

   "-they're transcending the bullshit," says Hassler, only his voice is
   earnest and clear and sweet like a high-school valedictorian's, as if he
   just said may next year's seniors remember our motto-"transcending the
   bullshit-"

   -a nice line of light there along the plastic, a straight rigid gleam from
   the past, from wherever Hassler came from. Now I'm doing it again, ah,
   that amiable itch, I just extracted a metaphor, a piece of transcendent
   bullshit, from this freaking toothbrush case-

   "-transcending the bullshit-"

   A TALL GUY COMES INTO THE WAREHOUSE WEARING SOME kind of blue and orange
   outfit like a mime harlequin's and with an orange Day-Glo mask painted on
   his face, so that he looks extraordinarily like The Spirit, if you
   remember that comic strip. This, I am told, is Ken Babbs, who used to be a
   helicopter pilot in Vietnam. I get to talking to him and I ask him what it
   was like in Vietnam and he says to me, very seriously:

   "You really want to know what it was like?"

   "Yeah."

   "Come over here. I'll show you."

   So he leads me back into the garage and he points to a cardboard box lying
   on the floor, just lying there amid all the general debris and madness.

   "It's all in there."

   "It's all in there?"

   "Right, right, right."

   I reach in there and lift out a typewritten manuscript, four or five
   hundred pages. I leaf through. It's a novel, about Vietnam. I look at
   Babbs. He gives me a smile of good fellowship with his Day-Glo mask
   glowing and crinkling up.

   "It's all in there?" I say. "Then I guess it takes a while to get it."

   "Yeah, yeah, right! right! right!" says Babbs, breaking into a laugh, as
   if I just said the funniest thing in the world. "Yeah! Yeah! Hah hah hah
   hah hah hah hah Right! Right!" with the mask glowing and bouncing around
   on his face. I lower the novel back into the box, and for days I would
   notice Babbs's novel about Vietnam lying out there on the floor, out in
   the middle of everything, as if waiting for a twister to whip it up and
   scatter it over San Francisco County, and Babbs would be somewhere around
   saying to some other bemused soul: "Yeah, yeah, right! right! right!"

   The Merry Pranksters were all rapidly assembling, waiting for Kesey.
   George Walker arrives. Walker has on no costume. He is just like some very
   clean-cut blond college kid wearing a T-shirt and corduroy pants, smiling
   and outgoing, just a good West Coast golden boy except for a few random
   notes like the Lotus racing car he has outside, painted with orange
   Day-Glo so that it lights up at dusk, skidding around the corners of the
   California suburbs in four-wheel drifts. And Paul Foster. Foster, I am
   told, is some kind of mad genius, a genius at computers, with all sorts of
   firms with names like Techniflex, Digitron, Solartex, Automaton, trying to
   hunt him down to lay money on him to do this or that for them . . .
   Whether he is a genius or not, I couldn't say. He certainly looks mad
   enough. He is hunched over in a corner, in a theater seat, an emaciated
   figure but with a vast accumulation of clothes. It looks like he has on
   about eight pairs of clown's pants, one on top of the other, each one
   filthier than the next one, all black, sooty, torn, mungey and fungous.
   His head is practically shaven and he is so thin that all the flesh seems
   to be gone off his head and when he contracts his jaw muscles it is as if
   some very clever anatomical diagram has been set in motion with little
   facial muscles, striations, sheathes, ligaments, tissues, nodules,
   integuments that nobody ever suspected before bunching up, popping out,
   springing into definition in a complex chain reaction. And he contracts
   his jaw muscles all the time, concentrating, with his head down and his
   eyes burning, concentrating on a drawing he is doing on a pad of paper, an
   extremely small but crucial drawing by the looks of his concentration . .
   .

   Black Maria sits on a folding chair and smiles ineffably but says nothing.
   One of the Flag People, a thin guy, tells me about Mexicans strung out on
   huaraches. Doris Delay tells me-

   "They're off on their own freak," Hassler continues, "and it may not look
   like much, but they're starting to transcend the bullshit. There's this
   old trinity, Power, Position, Authority, and why should they worship these
   old gods and these old forms of authority-"

   "Fuck God ... ehhhhh ... Fuck God ..."

   This is a voice behind a blanket curtain to one side. Somebody is back
   there rapping off what Hassler just said.

   "Fuck God. Up with the Devil."

   It is a very sleepy, dreamy voice, however. The curtain pulls back and
   standing there is a wiry little guy who looks like a pirate. Behind him,
   back in there behind the curtain, all sorts of wires, instruments, panels,
   speakers are all piled up, a glistening heap of electronic equipment, and
   the tape is back there going ... "In the Nowhere Mine ..." The guy looks
   like a pirate, as I said, with long black hair combed back Tarzan-style,
   and a mustache, and a gold ring through his left earlobe. He stares out,
   sleepily. In fact, he is a Hell's Angel. His name is Freewheeling Frank.
   He has on the Hell's Angels' "colors," meaning a jacket with insignia, a
   jacket with the sleeves cut off and the skull with the helmet on it and
   the wings and a lot of other arcane symbols.

   "Fuck God," says Freewheeling Frank. "Fuck all forms of... of. . ." and
   the words trail off in a kind of dreamy way, although his lips are still
   moving and he kind of puts his head down and trudges off into the gloom,
   toward the bus, with his hands flicking out, first this side, then the
   other, like Cassady, and he is off on his trip, like Cassady, and, all
   right, a Hell's Angel-and the Hassler brushes his teeth after every meal,
   in the middle of a Shell station tin-can economy-

   Just then Kesey arrives.

                                    chapter

                                      III

                               The Electric Suit

   THROUGH THE SHEET OF SUNLIGHT AT THE DOORWAY AND down the incline into the
   crazy gloom comes a panel truck and in the front seat is Kesey. The Chief;
   out on bail. I half expect the whole random carnival to well up into a
   fluorescent yahoo of incalculably insane proportions. In fact, everybody
   is quiet. It is all cool.

   Kesey gets out of the truck with his eyes down. He's wearing a sport
   shirt, an old pair of pants, and some Western boots. He seems to see me
   for an instant, but there is no hello, not a glimmer of recognition. This
   annoys me, but then I see that he doesn't say hello to anybody. Nobody
   says anything. They don't all rush up or anything. It's as if... Kesey is
   back and what is there to say about it.

   Then Mountain Girl booms out: "How was jail, Kesey!"

   Kesey just shrugs. "Where's my shirt?" he says.

   Mountain Girl fishes around in the debris over beside a bunch of theater
   seats and gets the shirt, a brown buckskin shirt with an open neck and red
   leather lacings. Kesey takes off the shirt he has on. He has huge
   latissimi dorsi muscles making his upper back fan out like manta-ray
   wings. Then he puts on the buckskin shirt and turns around.

   Instead of saying anything, however, he cocks his head to one side and
   walks across the garage to the mass of wires, speakers, and microphones
   over there and makes some minute adjustment. "... The Nowhere Mine ..." As
   if now everything is under control and the fine tuning begins.

   From out of the recesses of the garage-I didn't even know they were
   there-here comes a woman and three children. Kesey's wife Faye, their
   daughter Shannon, who is six, and two boys, Zane, five, and Jed, three.
   Faye has long, sorrel-brown hair and is one of the prettiest, most
   beatific-looking women I ever saw. She looks radiant, saintly. Kesey goes
   over to her and picks up each of the kids, and then Mountain Girl brings
   over her baby, Sunshine, and he picks up Sunshine a moment. All right-

   Then Kesey loosens up and smiles, as if he just thought of something. It
   is as if he just heard Mountain Girl's question about how was jail. "The
   only thing I was worried about was this tooth," he says. He pops a dental
   plate out of the roof of his mouth and pushes a false front tooth out of
   his mouth with his tongue. "I had the awfulest feeling," he says. "I was
   going to be in court or talking to reporters or something, and this thing
   was going to fall down like this and I was going to start gumming my
   words." He gums the words "start gumming my words," to illustrate.

   Three weeks later he was to replace it with a tooth with an orange star
   and green stripes on it, an enameled dens incisus lateral bearing a
   Prankster flag. One day at a gas station the manager, a white guy, gets
   interested in the tooth and calls over his helper, a colored guy, and
   says, "Hey, Charlie, come over here and show this fellow your tooth." So
   Charlie grins and bares his upper teeth, revealing a gold tooth with a
   heart cut out in the gold so that a white enamel heart shows through.
   Kesey grins back and then bares his tooth-the colored guy stares a moment
   and doesn't say anything. He doesn't even smile. He just turns away. A
   little while later, down the road, Kesey says very seriously, very
   sorrowfully, "That was wrong of me. I shouldn't have done that." "Done
   what?" "I outniggered him," says Kesey.

   Outniggered him! Kesey has kept these countryisms, like "the awfulest
   feeling," all through college, graduate school, days of literary
   celebration...

   "How did it happen?" says Freewheeling Frank, meaning the tooth.

   "He got in a fight with a Hell's Angel," says Mountain Girl.

   "What!-" Freewheeling Frank is truly startled.

   "Yeah!" says Mountain Girl. "The bastard hit him with a chain!"

   "What!" says Frank. "Where? What was his name!"

   Kesey gives Mountain Girl a look.

   "Naw," she says.

   "What was his name!" Frank says. "What did he look like!"

   "Mountain Girl is shucking you," Kesey says. "I was in a wreck."

   Mountain Girl looks repentant. Angels' duels are no joke with Frank. Kesey
   breaks up ... the vibrations. He sits down in one of the old theater
   seats. He is just talking in a soft, conversational tone, with his head
   down, just like he is having conversation with Mountain Girl or somebody.

   "It's funny," he says. "There are guys in jail who have been in jail so
   much, that's their whole thing. They're jail freaks. They've picked up the
   whole jail language-"

   -everybody starts gathering around, sitting in the old theater seats or on
   the floor. The mysto steam begins rising-

   "-only it isn't their language, it's the guards', the cops', the D.A.'s,
   the judge's. It's all numbers. One of them says, 'What happened to
   so-and-so?' And the other one says, 'Oh, he's over in 34,' which is a
   cellblock. 'They got him on a 211'-they have numbers for different things,
   just like you hear on a police radio-'they got him on a 211, but he can
   cop to a 213 and get three to five, one and a half with good behavior.'

   "The cops like that. It makes them feel better if you play their game.
   They'll chase some guy and run him down and pull guns on him and they're
   ready to blow his head off if he moves a muscle, but then as soon as they
   have him in jail, one of them will come around and ask him how his wife is
   and he's supposed to say she's O.K., thanks, and ask him about his kids,
   like now that we've played the cops-and-robbers part of the game, you can
   go ahead and like me. And a lot of them in there go along with that,
   because that's all they know.

   "When you're running, you're playing their game, too. I was up in
   Haight-Ashbury and I heard something hit the sidewalk behind me and it was
   a kid had fallen out the window. A lot of people rushed up and a woman was
   there crying and trying to pick him up, and I knew what I should do is go
   up and tell her not to move him but I didn't. I was afraid I was going to
   be recognized. And then up the street I saw a cop writing out parking
   tickets and I was going to go up and tell him to call an ambulance. But I
   didn't. I just kept going. And that night I was listening to the news on
   television and they told about a child who fell out of a window and died
   in the hospital."

   And that's what the cops-and-robbers game does to you. Only it is me
   thinking it. Figuring out parables, I look around at the faces and they
   are all watching Kesey and, I have not the slightest doubt, thinking: and
   that's what the cops-and-robbers game does to you. Despite the skepticism
   I brought here, I am suddenly experiencing their feeling. I am sure of it.
   I feel like I am in on something the outside world, the world I came from,
   could not possibly comprehend, and it is a metaphor, the whole scene,
   ancient and vast, vaster than ...

   TWO GUYS COME IN OUT OF THE DAYLIGHT ON HARRIET Street, heads by the looks
   of them, and walk up to Kesey. One of them is young with a sweatshirt on
   and Indian beads with an amulet hanging from the beads-a routine acid-head
   look, in other words. The other one, the older one, is curiously neat,
   however. He has long black hair, but neat, and a slightly twirly mustache,
   like a cavalier, but neat, and a wildly flowered shirt, but neat and
   well-tailored and expensive, and a black leather jacket, only not a
   motorcycle jacket but tailored more like a coat, and a pair of English
   boots that must have set him back $25 or $30. At first he looks like
   something out of Late North Beach, the boho with the thousand-dollar
   wardrobe. But he has a completely sincere look. He has a thin face with
   sharp features and a couple of eyes burning with truth oil. He says his
   name is Gary Goldhill and he wants to interview Kesey for the
   Haight-Ashbury newspaper The Oracle, and when could he do that-but right
   away it is obvious that he has something to get off his chest that can't
   wait.

   "The thing is, Ken"-he has an English accent, but it is a middle-class
   accent, a pleasant sort of Midlands accent-"the thing is, Ken, a lot of
   people are very concerned about what you've said, or what the newspapers
   say you've said, about graduating from acid. A lot of people look up to
   you, Ken, you're one of the heroes of the psychedelic movement"-he has a
   kind of Midlands England way of breaking up long words into syllables,
   psy-che-delic move-ment-"and they want to know what you mean. A very
   beautiful thing is happening in Haight-Ashbury, Ken. A lot of people are
   opening the doors in their minds for the first time, but people like you
   have to help them. There are only two directions we can go, Ken. We can
   isolate ourselves in a monastery or we can organize a religion, along the
   lines of the League for Spiritual Discovery"-the League for Spi-ri-tu-al
   Dis-cov-ery-"and have acid and grass legalized as sacraments, so everyone
   won't have to spend every day in fear waiting for the knock on the door."

   "It can be worse to take it as a sacrament," Kesey says.

   "You've been away for almost a year, Ken," Goldhill says. "You may not
   know what's been happening in Haight-Ashbury. It's growing, Ken, and
   thousands of people have found something very beautiful, and they're very
   open and loving, but the fear and the paranoia, Ken, the waiting for the
   knock on the door-it's causing some terrible things, Ken. It's
   re-spon-si-ble for a lot of bad trips. People are having bad trips, Ken,
   because they take acid and suddenly they feel that any moment there may be
   a knock on the door. We've got to band together. You've got to help us,
   Ken, and not work against us."

   Kesey looks up, away from Goldhill, out across the gloom of the garage.
   Then he speaks in a soft, far-off voice, with his eyes in the distance:

   "If you don't realize that I've been helping you with every fiber in my
   body ... if you don't realize that everything I've done, everything I've
   gone through ..."

   -it is rising and rising-

   "I know, Ken, but the repression-"

   "We're in a period now like St. Paul and the early Christians," Kesey
   says. "St. Paul said, if they shit on you in one city, move on to another
   city, and if they shit on you in that city, move on to another city-"

   "I know, Ken, but you're telling people to stop taking acid, and they're
   not going to stop. They've opened up doors in their minds they never knew
   existed, and a very beautiful thing, and then they read in the papers that
   somebody they've looked up to is suddenly telling them to stop."

   "There's a lot of things I can't tell the newspapers," says Kesey. His
   eyes are still focused long-range, away from Goldhill. "One night in
   Mexico, in Manzanillo, I took some acid and I threw the I Ching. And the I
   Ching-the great thing about the I Ching is, it never sends you Valentines,
   it slaps you in the face when you need it-and it said we had reached the
   end of something, we weren't going anywhere any longer, it was time for a
   new direction-and I went outside and there was an electrical storm, and
   there was lightning everywhere and I pointed to the sky and lightning
   flashed and all of a sudden I had a second skin, of lightning,
   electricity, like a suit of electricity, and I knew it was in us to be
   superheroes and that we could become superheroes or nothing." He lowers
   his eyes. "I couldn't tell this to the newspapers. How could I? I wouldn't
   be put back in jail, I'd be put in Pescadero."

   -rising-rising-

   "But most people aren't ready for that, Ken," Goldhill says. "They're just
   beginning to open the doors in their minds-"

   "But once you've been through that door, you can't just keep going through
   it over and over again-"

   "-and somebody's got to help them through that door-"

   "Don't say stop plunging into the forest," Kesey says. "Don't say stop
   being a pioneer and come back here and help these people through the door.
   If Leary wants to do that, that's good, it's a good thing and somebody
   should do it. But somebody has to be the pioneer and leave the marks for
   others to follow." Kesey looks up again, way out into the gloom. "You've
   got to have some faith in what you're trying to do. It's easy to have
   faith as long as it goes along with what you already know. But you've got
   to have faith in us all the way. Somebody like Gleason-Gleason was with us
   this far." Kesey spread his thumb and forefinger about two inches apart.
   "He was with us as long as our fantasy coincided with his. But as soon as
   we went on further, he didn't understand it, so he was going against us.
   He had ... no faith."

   No faith!-bay fog turns steam, hissing in the old cranium-

   Faith! Further! And it is an exceedingly strange feeling to be sitting
   here in the Day-Glo, on poor abscessed Harriet Street, and realize
   suddenly that in this improbably ex-pie factory Warehouse garage I am in
   the midst of Tsong-Isha-pa and the sangha communion, Mani and the wan
   persecuted at The Gate, Zoroaster, Maidhyoimaongha and the five faithful
   before Vish-tapu, Mohammed and Abu Bekr and the disciples amid the
   pharisaical Koreish of Mecca, Gautama and the brethren in the wilderness
   leaving the blood-and-kin families of their pasts for the one true family
   of the sangha inner circle-in short, true mystic brotherhood-only in poor
   old Formica polyethylene 1960s America without a grain of desert sand or a
   shred of palm leaf or a morsel of manna wilderness breadfruit overhead,
   picking up vibrations from Ampex tapes and a juggled Williams Lok-Hed
   sledge hammer, hooking down mathematical lab drugs, LSD-25, IT-290, DMT,
   instead of soma water, heading out in American flag airport coveralls and
   an International Harvester bus-yet for real!-amid the marshmallow shiny
   black shoe masses-

                                    chapter

                                       IV

                               What Do You Think

                                 of My Buddha?

   THE CURRENT FANTASY ... BY NOW, LATE EVENING, MOST of the Pranksters have
   cleared out of the Warehouse, off to take a shower at the apartment of
   Gut, an ex-Hell's Angel who has a psychedelic shop called Joint Ventures,
   off to here, off to there . .. Just Kesey and a couple of others left in
   the Warehouse. Kesey stands in the gloom of the Control Central, over to
   the side amid the tapes, and cans of movie film marked with adhesive
   strips, and notebooks and microphones and wires and coils, speakers,
   amplifiers. The Prankster Archives-and a tape drones on in a weird voice,
   full of Ouija-whammy:

   "... the blissful counterstroke ... a considerable new message ..."

   A considerable new message ... The current fantasy ... Fantasy is a word
   Kesey has taken to using more and more, for all sorts of plans, ventures,
   world views, ambitions. It is a good word. It is ironic and it isn't. It
   refers to everything from getting hold of a pickup truck-"that's our
   fantasy for this week-

   end"--to some scary stuff out on the raggedy raggedy edge ... like the
   current fantasy, which is somehow to be told at the Acid Test Graduation.
   But how to tell it? Kesey rummages through the film cans and assorted . ..
   Archives ... It has never been possible, has it, truly, just to come out
   and announce the current fantasy, not even in days gone by, when it seemed
   so simple. Now, you take Goldhill, who was just in here with the truth in
   his eyes. He will come closer than most. Kesey could see it. Goldhill was
   open... and into the pudding. He had his own fantasy, the League for
   Spi-ri-tu-al Dis-cov-ery, and yet he is the rare kind who might even be
   willing to move with their fantasy, his and the Pranksters'. It takes a
   rare kind. Because always comes the moment when it's time to take the
   Prankster circus further on toward Edge City. And always at that point
   some good souls are startled: Hey, wait! Like Ralph Gleason with his
   column in the Chronicle and his own clump of hipness. Gleason is one of
   those people ... Kesey can remember them all, people who thought he was
   great so long as his fantasy coincided with theirs. But every time he
   pushed on further-and he always pushed on further-they became confused and
   resentful . . . The tape winds on:

   "... the blissful counterstroke ... through workhorse and intercourse ...
   the blood that was available to him in intercourse ... made us believe he
   was in the apple sauce for twenty years . . ."

   Only lucky dogs and Merry Pranksters can understand this supersonic
   warble! ... most likely .. .

   ". .. the blissful counterstroke . .."

   ... the current fantasy ... Even back on Perry Lane, where everyone was
   young and intellectual and analytical, and the sky, supposedly, was the
   limit-there was no way he could just come right out and say: Come in a
   little closer, friends ... They had their own fantasy for him: he was a
   "diamond in the rough." Wellllll, that was all right, being a diamond in
   the rough. He had gone to Stanford University in 1958 on a
   creative-writing fellowship, and they had taken him in on Perry Lane
   because he was such a swell diamond in the rough. Perry Lane was
   Stanford's bohemian quarter. As bohemias go, Perry Lane was Arcadia,
   Arcadia just off the Stanford golf course. It was a cluster of two-room
   cottages with weathery wood shingles in an oak forest, only not just amid
   trees and greenery, but amid vines, honeysuckle tendrils, all buds and
   shoots and swooping tendrils and twitterings like the best of Arthur
   Rackham and Honey Bear. Not only that, it had true cultural cachet.
   Thorstein Veblen had lived there. So had two Nobel Prize winners everybody
   knew about though the names escaped them. The cottages rented for just $60
   a month. Getting into Perry Lane was like getting into a club. Everybody
   who lived there had known somebody else who lived there, or they would
   never have gotten in, and naturally they got to know each other very
   closely too, and there was always something of an atmosphere of communal
   living. Nobody's door was ever shut on Perry Lane, except when they were
   pissed off.

   It was sweet. Perry Lane was a typical 1950s bohemia. Everybody sat around
   shaking their heads over America's tailfin, housing-development
   civilization, and Christ, in Europe, so what if the plumbing didn't work,
   they had mastered the art of living. Occasionally somebody would suggest
   an orgy or a three-day wine binge, but the model was always that old Zorba
   the Greek romanticism of sandals and simplicity and back to first
   principles. Periodically they would take pilgrimages 40 miles north to
   North Beach to see how it was actually done.

   The main figures on Perry Lane were two novelists, Robin White, who had
   just written the Harper Prize novel, Elephant Hill, and Gwen Davis, a kind
   of West Coast Dawn Powell. In any case, all the established Perry Laners
   could see Kesey coming a mile away.

   He had Jack London Martin Eden Searching Hick, the hick with intellectual
   yearnings, written all over him. He was from Oregon-who the hell was ever
   from Oregon?-and he had an Oregon country drawl and too many muscles and
   callouses on his hands and his brow furrowed when he was thinking hard,
   and it was perfect.

   White took Kesey under his wing and got him and his wife Faye a cottage on
   Perry Lane. The Perry Lane set liked the idea at once. He could always be
   counted on to do perfect things. Like the time they were all having
   dinner-there was a lot of communal dining-and some visitor was going on
   about the ineffable delicacy of James Baldwin's work, and Kesey keeps
   eating but also trying to edge a word in saying, well, bub, I dunno, I
   cain't exactly go along with you there, and the fellow puts down his knife
   and fork very carefully and turns to the others and says,

   "I'll be delighted to listen to whatever Mr. Kesey has to say-as soon as
   he learns to eat from a plate without holding down his meat with his
   thumb."

   Perfect! He had been voted "most likely to succeed" at his high school in
   Springfield, Oregon, and had graduated from the University of Oregon,
   where he was all involved in sports and fraternities, the Ail-American Boy
   bit. He had been a star wrestler in the 174-pound class and a star actor
   in college plays. He had even gone to Los Angeles after he finished
   college, and knocked around Hollywood for a while with the idea of
   becoming a movie star. But the urge to write, to create, had burst up
   through all this thick lumpy All-American crap somehow, like an
   unaccountable purslane blossom, and he had started writing, even
   completing a novel about college athletics, End of Autumn. It had never
   been published, and probably never would be, but he had the longing to do
   this thing. And his background-it was great, too. Somehow the Perry Lane
   set got the idea that his family were Okies, coming out of the Dust Bowl
   during the Depression, and then up to Oregon, wild, sodden Oregon, where
   they had fought the land and shot bears and the rivers were swift and the
   salmon leaped silver in the spring big two-hearted rivers.

   His wife Faye-she was from the same kind of background, only she came from
   Idaho, and they had been high-school sweethearts in Springfield, Oregon,
   and had run off and gotten married when they were both freshmen in
   college. They once made a bet as to which of them had been born in the
   most Low Rent, bottomdog shack, his old place in La Junta, or hers in
   Idaho. He was dead sure there was no beating La Junta for Rundown until
   they got to Idaho, and she sure as hell did win that one. Faye was even
   more soft-spoken than Kesey. She hardly spoke at all. She was pretty and
   extremely sweet, practically a madonna of the hill country. And their
   cottage on Perry Lane-well, everybody else's cottage was run-down in a
   careful bohemian way, simplicity, Japanese paper lamp globes and monk's
   cloth and blond straw rugs and Swedish stainless steel knives and forks
   and cornflowers sticking out of a hand-thrown pot. But theirs was just
   plain Low Rent. There was always something like a broken washing machine
   rusting on the back porch and pigweed, bladderpods, scoke and scurf peas
   growing ragged out back. Somehow it was. . . perfect... to have him and
   Faye on hand to learn as the Perry Lane sophisticates talked about life
   and the arts.

   BEAUTIFUL! . . . THE CURRENT FANTASY . . . BUT HOW TO TELL them?-about
   such arcane little matters as Captain Marvel and The Flash ... and The
   Life-and the very Superkids-

   "... a considerable new message . . . the blissful counter-stroke ..."

   -when they had such a nice clear picture of him as the horny-nailed son of
   the Western sod, fresh from Springfield, Oregon. It was true that his
   father, Fred Kesey, had started him and his younger brother, Joe, known as
   Chuck, shooting and fishing and swimming as early as they could in any way
   manage it, also boxing, running, wrestling, plunging down the rapids of
   the Willamette and the McKenzie Rivers, on inner-tube rafts, with a lot of
   rocks and water and sartin' death foamin' down below. But it was not so
   they could tame animals, forests, rivers, wild upturned convulsed Oregon.
   It was more to condition them to do more of what his father had already
   done a pretty good job

   of-claim whatever he can rightly get by being man enough to take it, and
   not on the frontier, either .. . Kesey Sr. had been part of the 1940s
   migration from the Southwest-not of "Okies" but of Protestant
   entrepreneurs who looked to the West Coast as a land of business
   opportunity. He started out in the Willamette Valley with next to nothing
   and founded a marketing cooperative for dairy farmers, the Eugene Farmers
   Cooperative, and built it into the biggest dairy operation in the area,
   retailing under the name of Darigold. He was one of the big postwar
   success stories in the Valley-and ended up not in an old homestead with
   wood sidings and lightning rods but in a modern home in the suburbs,
   lowslung and pastel, on a street called Debra Lane. The incredible postwar
   American electro-pastel surge into the suburbs!-it was sweeping the
   Valley, with superhighways, dream-boat cars, shopping centers, soaring
   thirty-foot Federal Sign & Signal Company electric supersculptures-Eight
   New Plexiglas Display Features!-a surge of freedom and mobility, of cars
   and the money to pay for them and the time to enjoy them and a home where
   you can laze in a rich pool of pale wall-to-wall or roar through the
   technological wonderworld in motor launches and, in the case of men like
   his father, private planes-

   The things he would somehow suddenly remember about the old home town-over
   here, for example, is the old white clapboard house they used to live in,
   and behind it, back a ways, is the radio tower of station KORE with a red
   light blinking on top-and at night he used to get down on his knees to say
   his prayers and there would be the sky and the light blinking-and he
   always kind of thought he was praying to that red light. And the old
   highway used to take a bend right about here, and it seemed like there was
   always somebody driving through about three or four in the morning, half
   asleep, and they would see the lights over there in town where it was
   getting built up and they'd think the road headed straight for the lights
   and they'd run off the bend and Kesey and his dad would go out to see if
   they could help the guy draggle himself out of the muck-chasing street
   lights!-praying to the red beacon light of KORE!-and a little run-in at
   Gregg's Drive-in, as it used to be called, it is now Speck's, at Franklin
   Boulevard at the bridge over the river. That was the big high-school
   drive-in, with the huge streamlined sculpted pastel display sign with
   streaming streamlined super-slick A-22 italic script, floodlights,
   clamp-on trays, car-hop girls in floppy blue slacks, hamburgers in some
   kind of tissuey wax paper steaming with onions pressed down and fried on
   the grill and mustard and catsup to squirt all over it from out plastic
   squirt cylinders. Saturday nights when everybody is out cruising-some guy
   was in his car in the lot at Gregg's going the wrong way, so nobody could
   move. The more everybody blew the horns, the more determined the guy got.
   Like this was the test. He rolls up the windows and locks the doors so
   they can't get at him and keeps boring in. This guy vs. Kesey. So Kesey
   goes inside and gets a potato they make the french fries with and comes
   out and jams it over the guy's exhaust pipe, which causes the motor to
   conk out and you ain't going any which way now, bub. The guy brings
   charges against Kesey for ruining his engine and Kesey ends up in juvenile
   court before a judge and tries to tell him how it is at Gregg's Drive-In
   on a Saturday night: The Life-that feeling-The Life-the late 1940s early
   1950s American Teenage Drive-in Life was precisely what it was all
   about-but how could you tell anyone about it?

   But of course!-the feeling-out here at night, free, with the motor running
   and the adrenaline flowing, cruising in the neon glories of the new
   American night-it was very Heaven to be the first wave of the most
   extraordinary kids in the history of the world-only 15, 16, 17 years old,
   dressed in the haute couture of pink Oxford shirts, sharp pants, snaky
   half-inch belts, fast shoes-with all this Straight-6 and V-8 power
   underneath and all this neon glamour overhead, which somehow tied in with
   the technological superheroics of the jet, TV, atomic subs,
   ultrasonics-Postwar American suburbs-glorious world! and the hell with the
   intellectual bad-mouthers of America's tailfin civilization... They
   couldn't know what it was like or else they had it cultivated out of
   them-the feeling-to be very Superkids ! the world's first generation of
   the little devils-feeling immune, beyond calamity. One's parents
   remembered the sloughing common order, War & Depression-but Superkids knew
   only the emotional surge of the great payoff, when nothing was common any
   longer-The Life! A glorious place, a glorious age, I tell you! A very Neon
   Renaissance-And the myths that actually touched you at that time-not
   Hercules, Orpheus, Ulysses, and Aeneas-but Superman, Captain Marvel,
   Batman, The Human Torch, The Sub-Mariner, Captain America, Plastic Man,
   The Flash-but of course! On Perry Lane, what did they think it
   was-quaint?-when he talked about the comic-book Super-heroes as the honest
   American myths? It was a fantasy world already, this electro-pastel world
   of Mom&Dad&Buddy&Sis in the suburbs. There they go, in the family car, a
   white Pontiac Bonneville sedan-the family car!-a huge crazy
   god-awful-powerful fantasy creature to begin with, 327 horsepower, shaped
   like twenty-seven nights of lubricious luxury brougham seduction-you're
   already there, in Fantasyland, so why not move off your smug-harbor
   quilty-bed dead center and cut loose-go ahead and say it-Shazam!-juice it
   up to what it's already aching to be: 327,000 horsepower, a whole
   superhighway long and soaring, screaming on toward ... Edge City, and
   ultimate fantasies, current and future ... Billy Batson said Shazam! and
   turned into Captain Marvel. Jay Garrick inhaled an experimental gas in the
   research lab ...

   ... AND BEGAN TRAVELING AND THINKING AT THE SPEED OF light as... The Flash
   .. . the current fantasy. Yes. The Kesey diamond-in-the-rough fantasy did
   not last very long. The most interesting person on Perry Lane as far as he
   was concerned was not any of the novelists or other literary
   intellectuals, but a young graduate student in psychology named Vic
   Lovell. Lovell was like a young Viennese analyst, or at least a California
   graduate-school version of one. He was slender with wild dark hair and
   very cool intellectually and wound-up at the same time. He introduced
   Kesey to Freudian psychology. Kesey had never run into a system of thought
   like this before. Lovell could point out in the most persuasive way how
   mundane character traits and minor hassles around Perry Lane fit into the
   richest, most complex metaphor of life ever devised, namely, Freud's... .
   And a little experimental gas . . . Yes. Lovell told him about some
   experiments the Veterans Hospital in Menlo Park was running with
   "psychomimetic" drugs, drugs that brought on temporary states resembling
   psychoses. They were paying volunteers $75 a day. Kesey volunteered. It
   was all nicely calcimined and clinical. They would put him on a bed in a
   white room and give him a series of capsules without saying what they
   were. One would be nothing, a placebo. One would be Ditran, which always
   brought on a terrible experience. Kesey could always tell that one coming
   on, because the hairs on the blanket he was under would suddenly look like
   a field of hideously diseased thorns and he would put his finger down his
   throat and retch. But one of them-the first thing he knew about it was a
   squirrel dropped an acorn from a tree outside, only it was tremendously
   loud and sounded like it was not outside but right in the room with him
   and not actually a sound, either, but a great suffusing presence, visual,
   almost tactile, a great impacting of... blue... all around him and
   suddenly he was in a realm of consciousness he had never dreamed of before
   and it was not a dream or a delirium but part of his awareness. He looks
   at the ceiling. It begins moving. Panic-and yet there is no panic. The
   ceiling is moving-not in a crazed swirl but along its own planes its own
   planes of light and shadow and surface not nearly so nice and smooth as
   plasterer Super Plaster Man intended with infallible carpenter level
   bubble sliding in dim honey Karo syrup tube not so foolproof as you
   thought, bub, little lumps and ridges up there, bub, and lines, lines like
   spines on crests of waves of white desert movie sand each one with MGM
   shadow longshot of the ominous A-rab coming up over the next crest for
   only the sinister Saracen can see the road and you didn't know how many
   subplots you left up there, Plaster Man, trying to smooth it all out, all
   of it, with your bubble in a honey tube carpenter's level, to make us all
   down here look up and see nothing but ceiling, because we all know
   ceiling, because it has a name, ceiling, therefore it is nothing but a
   ceiling-no room for A-rabs up there in Level Land, eh, Plaster Man.
   Suddenly he is like a ping-pong ball in a flood of sensory stimuli, heart
   beating, blood coursing, breath suspiring, teeth grating, hand moving over
   the percale sheet over those thousands of minute warfy woofings like a
   brush fire, sun glow and the highlight on a stainless-steel rod, quite a
   little movie you have going on in that highlight there, Hondo,
   Technicolors, pick each one out like fishing for neon gumballs with a
   steam shovel in the Funtime Arcade, a ping-pong ball in a flood of sensory
   stimuli, all quite ordinary, but... revealing themselves for the first
   time and happening... Now... as if for the first time he has entered a
   moment in his life and known exactly what is happening to his senses now,
   at this moment, and with each new discovery it is as if he has entered
   into all of it himself, is one with it, the movie white desert of the
   ceiling becomes something rich, personal, his, beautiful beyond
   description, like an orgasm behind the eyeballs, and his A-rabs-A-rabs
   behind the eyelids, eyelid movies, room for them and a lot more in the
   five billion thoughts per second stroboscope synapses-his A-rab heroes,
   fine Daily Double horsehair mustaches wrapped about the Orbicularis Oris
   of their mouths-

   Face! The doctor comes back in and, marvelous, poor tight cone ass, doc,
   Kesey can now see into him. For the first time he notices that the
   doctor's lower left lip is trembling, but he more than sees the tremor, he
   understands it, he can-almost seen!-see each muscle fiber decussate,
   pulling the poor jelly of his lip to the left and the fibers one by one
   leading back into infrared caverns of the body, through transistor-radio
   innards of nerve tangles, each one on Red Alert, the poor ninny's inner
   hooks desperately trying to make the little writhing bastards keep still
   in there, I am Doctor, this is a human specimen before me-the poor ninny
   has his own desert movie going on inside, only each horsehair A-rab is a
   threat-if only his lip, his face, would stay level, level like the honey
   bubble of the Official Plaster Man assured him it would-

   Miraculous! He could truly see into people for the first time-

   And yes, that little capsule sliding blissly down the gullet was LSD.

   VERY SOON IT WAS ALREADY TIME TO PUSH ON BEYOND another fantasy, the
   fantasy of the Menlo Park clinicians. The clinicians' fantasy was that the
   volunteers were laboratory animals that had to be dealt with objectively,
   quantitatively. It was well known that people who volunteered for drug
   experiments tended to be unstable anyway. So the doctors would come in in
   white smocks, with the clipboards, taking blood pressures and heart rates
   and urine specimens and having them try to solve simple problems in logic
   and mathematics, such as adding up columns of figures, and having them
   judge time and distances, although they did have them talk into tape
   recorders, too. But the doctors were so out of it. They never took LSD
   themselves and they had absolutely no comprehension, and it couldn't be
   put into words anyway.

   Sometimes you wanted to paint it huge-Lovell is under LSD in the clinic
   and he starts drawing a huge Buddha on the wall. It somehow encompasses
   the whole-White Smock comes in and doesn't even look at it, he just starts
   asking the old questions on the clipboard, so Lovell suddenly butts in:

   "What do you think of my Buddha?"

   White Smock looks at it a moment and says, "It looks very feminine. Now
   let's see how rapidly you can add up this column of figures here ..."

   Very feminine. Deliver us from the cliches that have locked up even these
   so-called experimenters' brains like the accordion fences in the fur-store
   window-and Kesey was having the same problem with his boys. One of them
   was a young guy with a lie-down crewcut and the straightest face, the
   straightest, blandest, most lineless awfulest Plaster Man honey bubble
   levelest face ever made, and he would come in and open his eyes wide once
   as if to make sure this muscular hulk on the bed were still rational and
   then get this smug tone in his voice which poured out into the room like
   absorbent cotton choked in chalk dust from beaten erasers Springfield High
   School.

   "Now when I say 'Go,' you tell me when you think a minute is up by saying,
   'Now.' Have you got that?"

   Yeah, he had that. Kesey was soaring on LSD and his sense of time was
   wasted, and thousands of thoughts per second were rapping around between
   synapses, fractions of a second, so what the hell is a minute-but then one
   thought stuck in there, held ... ma-li-cious, de-li-cious. He remembered
   that his pulse had been running 75 beats a minute every time they took it,
   so when Dr. Fog says 'Go,' Kesey slyly slides his slithering finger onto
   his pulse and counts up to 75 and says:

   "Now!"

   Dr. Smog looks at his stop watch. "Amazing!" he says, and walks out of the
   room.

   You said it, bub, but like a lot of other people, you don't even know.

   LSD; HOW CAN - NOW THAT THOSE BIG FAT LETTERS ARE babbling out on coated
   stock from every newsstand ... But this was late 1959, early 1960, a full
   two years before Mom&Dad&Buddy&Sis heard of the dread letters and clucked
   because Drs. Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert were french-frying the
   brains of Harvard boys with it. It was even before Dr. Humphry Osmond had
   invented the term "psychodelic," which was later amended to "psychedelic"
   to get rid of the nuthouse connotation of "psycho" ... LSD! It was quite a
   little secret to have stumbled onto, a hulking supersecret, in fact-the
   triumph of the guinea pigs! In a short time he and Lovell had tried the
   whole range of the drugs, LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, peyote, IT-290 the
   superamphetamine, Ditran the bummer, morning-glory seeds. They were onto a
   discovery that the Menlo Park clinicians themselves never-mighty fine
   irony here: the White Smocks were supposedly using them. Instead the White
   Smocks had handed them the very key itself. And you don't even know, bub .
   .. with these drugs your perception is altered enough that you find
   yourself looking out of completely strange eyeholes. All of us have a
   great deal of our minds locked shut. We're shut off from our own world.
   Aand these drugs seem to be the key to open these locked doors. How
   many?-maybe two dozen people in the world were on to this incredible
   secret! One was Aldous Huxley, who had taken mescaline and written about
   it in The Doors of Perception. He compared the brain to a "reducing
   valve." In ordinary perception, the senses send an overwhelming flood of
   information to the brain, which the brain then filters down to a trickle
   it can manage for the purpose of survival in a highly competitive world.
   Man has become so rational, so utilitarian, that the trickle becomes most
   pale and thin. It is efficient, for mere survival, but it screens out the
   most wondrous part of man's potential experience without his even knowing
   it. We're shut off from our own world. Primitive man once experienced the
   rich and sparkling flood of the senses fully. Children experience it for a
   few months-until "normal" training, conditioning, close the doors on this
   other world, usually for good. Somehow, Huxley had said, the drugs opened
   these ancient doors. And through them modern man may at last go, and
   rediscover his divine birthright-

   But these are words, man! And you couldn't put it into words. The White
   Smocks liked to put it into words, like hallucination and dissociative
   phenomena. They could understand the visual skyrockets. Give them a good
   case of an ashtray turning into a Venus flytrap or eyelid movies of
   crystal cathedrals, and they could groove on that, Kluver, op cit., p.
   43n. That was swell. But don't you see?-the visual stuff was just the
   decor with LSD. In fact, you might go through the whole experience without
   any true hallucination. The whole thing was... the experience... this
   certain indescribable  feeling. .. Indescribable, because words can only
   jog the memory, and if there is no memory of... The experience of the
   barrier between the subjective and the objective, the personal and the
   impersonal, the / and the not-I disappearing ... that feeling!... Or can
   you remember when you were a child watching someone put a pencil to a
   sheet of paper for the first time, to draw a picture ... and the line
   begins to grow-into a nose! and it is not just a pattern of graphite line
   on a sheet of paper but the very miracle of creation itself and your own
   dreams flowed into that magical... growing... line, and it was not a
   picture but a miracle... an experience... and now that you're soaring on
   LSD that feeling is coming on again-only now the creation is of the entire
   universe-

   MEANWHILE, OVER ON PERRY LANE, THIS Wasn't PRECISELY the old Searching
   Hick they all knew and loved. Suddenly Kesey-well, he was soft-spoken, all
   right, but he came on with a lot of vital energy. Gradually the whole
   Perry Lane thing was gravitating around Kesey. Volunteer Kesey gave
   himself over to science over at the Menlo Park Vets hospital-and somehow
   drugs were getting up and walking out of there and over to Perry Lane,
   LSD, mescaline, IT-290, mostly. Being hip on Perry Lane now had an element
   nobody had ever dreamed about before, wild-flying, mind-blowing drugs.
   Some of the old Perry Lane luminaries' cool was tested and they were found
   wanting. Robin White and Gwen Davis were against the new drug thing. That
   was all right, because Kesey had had about enough of them, and the power
   was with Kesey. Perry Lane took on a kind of double personality, which is
   to say, Kesey's. Half the time it would be just like some kind of college
   fraternity row, with everybody out on a nice autumn Saturday afternoon on
   the grass in the dapple shadows of the trees and honeysuckle tendrils
   playing touch football or basketball. An hour later, however, Kesey and
   his circle would be hooking down something that in the entire world only
   they and a few avant-garde neuropharmacological researchers even knew
   about, drugs of the future, of the neuropharmacologists' centrifuge
   utopia, the coming age of. . .

   Well shee-ut. An' I don't reckon we give much of a damn any more about the
   art of living in France, either, boys, every frog ought to have a little
   paunch, like Henry Miller said, and go to bed every night in pajamas with
   collars and piping on them-just take a letter for me and mail it down to
   old Morris at Morris Orchids, Laredo, Texas, boys, tell him about enough
   peyote cactus to mulch all the mouldering widows' graves in poor placid
   Palo Alto. Yes. They found out they could send off to a place called
   Morris Orchids in Laredo and get peyote, and one of the new games of Perry
   Lane-goodbye Robin, goodbye Gwen-got to be seeing who was going down to
   the Railway Express at the railroad station and pick up the shipment,
   since possession of peyote, although not of LSD, was already illegal in
   California. There would be these huge goddamned boxes of the stuff, 1,000
   buds and roots $70; buds only-slightly higher. If they caught you, you
   were caught, because there was no excuse possible. There was no other
   earthly reason to have these goddamned fetid plants except to get high as
   a coon. And they would all set about cutting them into strips and putting
   them out to dry, it took days, and then grinding them up into powder and
   packing them in gelatin capsules or boiling it down to a gum and putting
   it in the capsules or just making a horrible goddamned broth that was so
   foul, so unbelievably vile, you had to chill it numb to try to kill the
   taste and fast for a day so you wouldn't have anything on your stomach,
   just to keep eight ounces of it down. But then-soar. Perry Lane, Perry
   Lane.

   Faces

   Faces

   Faces

   Faces

   so many faces rolling up behind the eyelids, faces he has never seen

   before, complete with spectral cheekbones, pregnant eyes, stringy wattles,
   and all of a sudden: Chief Broom. For some reason peyote does this...
   Kesey starts getting eyelid movies of faces, whole galleries of weird
   faces, churning up behind the eyelids, faces from out of nowhere. He knows
   nothing about Indians and has never met an Indian, but suddenly here is a
   full-blown Indian-Chief Broom-the solution, the whole mothering key, to
   the novel...

   HE HADN'T EVEN MEANT TO WRITE THIS BOOK. HE HAD BEEN working on another
   one, called Zoo about North Beach. Lovell had suggested why didn't he get
   a job as night attendant on the psychiatrie ward at Menlo Park. He could
   make some money, and since there wasn't much doing on the ward at night,
   he could work on Zoo. But Kesey got absorbed in the life on the
   psychiatric ward. The whole system-if they set out to invent the perfect
   Anti-cure for what ailed the men on this ward, they couldn't have done it
   better. Keep them cowed and docile. Play on the weakness that drove them
   nuts in the first place. Stupefy the bastards with tranquilizers and if
   they still get out of line haul them up to the "shock shop" and punish
   them. Beautiful-

   Sometimes he would go to work high on acid. He could see into their faces.
   Sometimes he wrote, and sometimes he drew pictures of the patients, and as
   the lines of the ball-point greasy creased into the paper the lines of
   their faces, he could-the interiors of these men came into the lines, the
   ball-point crevasses, it was the most incredible feeling, the anguish and
   the pain came right out front and flowed in the crevasses in their faces,
   and in the ball-point crevasses, the same-one!-crevasses now, black
   starling nostrils, black starling eyes, blind black starling geek cry on
   every face: "Me! Me! Me! Me! I am-Me!"-he could see clear into them.
   And-how could you tell anybody about this? they'll say you're a nut
   yourself-but afterwards, not high on anything, he could still see into
   people.

   The novel, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, was about a roustabout named
   Randle McMurphy. He is a big healthy animal, but he decides to fake
   insanity in order to get out of a short jail stretch he is serving on a
   work farm and into what he figures will be the soft life of a state mental
   hospital. He comes onto the ward with his tight reddish-blond curls
   tumbling out from under his cap, cracking jokes and trying to get some
   action going among these deadasses in the loony bin. They can't resist the
   guy. They suddenly want to do things. The tyrant who runs the place, Big
   Nurse, hates him for weakening .. . Control, and the System. By and by,
   many of the men resent him for forcing them to struggle to act like men
   again. Finally, Big Nurse is driven to play her trump card and finish off
   McMurphy by having him lobotomized. But this crucifixion inspires an
   Indian patient, a schizoid called Chief Broom, to rise up and break out of
   the hospital and go sane: namely, run like hell for open country.

   Chief Broom. The very one. From the point of view of craft, Chief Broom
   was his great inspiration. If he had told the story through McMurphy's
   eyes, he would have had to end up with the big bruiser delivering a lot of
   homilies about his down-home theory of mental therapy. Instead, he told
   the story through the Indian. This way he could present a schizophrenic
   state the way the schizophrenic himself, Chief Broom, feels it and at the
   same time report the McMurphy Method more subtly.

   Morris Orchids! He wrote several passages of the book under peyote and
   LSD. He even had someone give him a shock treatment, clandestinely, so he
   could write a passage in which Chief Broom comes back from "the shock
   shop." Eating Laredo buds-he would write like mad under the drugs. After
   he came out of it, he could see that a lot of it was junk. But certain
   passages-like Chief Broom in his schizophrenic fogs-it was true vision, a
   little of what you could see if you opened the doors of perception,
   friends . . .

   RIGHT AFTER HE FINISHED ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, Kesey sublet his
   cottage on Perry Lane and he and Faye went back up to Oregon. This was in
   June, 1961. He spent the summer working in his brother Chuck's creamery in
   Springfield to accumulate some money. Then he and Faye moved into a little
   house in Florence, Oregon, about 50 miles west of Springfield, near the
   ocean, in logging country. Kesey started gathering material for his second
   novel, Sometimes a Great Notion, which was about a logging family. He took
   to riding early in the morning and at night in the "crummies." These were
   pickup trucks that served as buses taking the loggers to and from the
   camps. At night he would hang around the bars where the loggers went. He
   was Low Rent enough himself to talk to them. After about four months of
   that, they headed back to Perry Lane, where he was going to do the
   writing.

   ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST WAS PUBLISHED IN FEBRUARY, 1962, and it
   made his literary reputation immediately:

   "A smashing achievement"-Mark Schorer

   "A great new American novelist"-Jack Kerouac

   "Powerful poetic realism"-Life

   "An amazing first novel"-Boston Traveler

   "This is a first novel of special worth"-New York Herald Tribune

   "His storytelling is so effective, his style so impetuous, his grasp of
   characters so certain, that the reader is swept along... His is a large,
   robust talent, and he has written a large, robust book"-Saturday Review

   AND ON THE LANE - ALL THIS WAS A CONFIRMATION OF everything they and Kesey
   had been doing. For one thing there was the old Drug Paranoia-the fear
   that this wild uncharted drug thing they were into would gradually... rot
   your brain. Well, here was the answer. Chief Broom!

   And McMurphy ... but of course. The current fantasy ... he was a McMurphy
   figure who was trying to get them to move off their own snug-harbor dead
   center, out of the plump little game of being ersatz daring and ersatz
   alive, the middle-class intellectual's game, and move out to ... Edge City
   ... where it was scary, but people were whole people. And if drugs were
   what unlocked the doors and enabled you to do this thing and realize all
   this that was in you, then so let it be ...

   Not even on Perry Lane did people really seem to catch the thrust of the
   new book he was working on, Sometimes a Great Notion. It was about the
   head of a logging clan, Hank Stamper,

   who defies a labor union and thereby the whole community he lives in by
   continuing his logging operation through a strike. It was an unusual book.
   It was a novel in which the strikers are the villains and the
   strikebreaker is the hero. The style was experimental and sometimes
   difficult. And the main source of "mythic" reference was not Sophocles or
   even Sir James Frazer but... yes, Captain Marvel. The union leaders, the
   strikers, and the townspeople were the tarantulas, all joyfully taking
   their vow: "We shall wreak vengeance and abuse on all whose equals we are
   not... and 'will to equality' shall henceforth be the name for virtue; and
   against all that has power we want to raise our clamor!" Hank Stamper was,
   quite intentionally, Captain Marvel. Once known as.. . Ubermensch. The
   current fantasy ...

   ... on Perry Lane. Nighttime, the night he and Faye and the kids came back
   to Perry Lane from Oregon, and they pull up to the old cottage and there
   is a funny figure in the front yard, smiling and rolling his shoulders
   this way and that and jerking his hands out to this side and the other
   side as if there's a different drummer somewhere, different drummer, you
   understand, corked out of his gourd, in fact... and, well, Hi, Ken, yes,
   uh, well, you weren't around, exactly, you understand, doubledy-clutch,
   doubledy-clutch, and they told me you wouldn't mind, generosity knoweth
   no-ahem-yes, I had a '47 Pontiac myself once, held the road like a
   prehistoric bird, you understand ... and, yes, Neal Cassady had turned up
   in the old cottage, like he had just run out of the pages of On the Road,
   and ... what's next, Chief? Ah .. . many Day-Glo freaking curlicues-

   All sorts of people began gathering around Perry Lane. Quite an...
   underground sensation it was, in Hip California. Kesey, Cassady, Larry
   McMurtry; two young writers, Ed McClanahan and Bob Stone; Chloe Scott the
   dancer, Roy Seburn the artist, Carl Lehmann-Haupt, Vic Lovell... and
   Richard Alpert him-self... all sorts of people were in and out of there
   all the time, because they had heard about it, like the local beats-that
   term was still used-a bunch of kids from a pad called the Chateau, a
   wildhaired kid named Jerry Garcia and the Cadaverous Cowboy, Page
   Browning. Everybody was attracted by the strange high times they had heard
   about... the Lane's fabled Venison Chili, a Kesey dish made of venison
   stew laced with LSD, which you could consume and then go sprawl on the
   mattress in the fork of the great oak in the middle of the Lane at night
   and play pinball with the light show in the sky . .. Perry Lane.

   And many puzzled souls looking in ... At first they were captivated. The
   Lane was too good to be true. It was Walden Pond, only without any Thoreau
   misanthropes around. Instead, a community of intelligent, very open,
   out-front people-out front was a term everybody was using-out-front people
   who cared deeply for one another, and shared... in incredible ways, even,
   and were embarked on some kind of... well, adventure in living. Christ,
   you could see them trying to put their finger on it and ... then .. .
   gradually figuring out there was something here they weren't in on ...
   Like the girl that afternoon in somebody's cottage when Alpert came by.
   This was a year after he started working with Timothy Leary. She had met
   Alpert a couple of years before and he had been 100 percent the serious
   young clinical psychologist-legions of rats and cats in cages with their
   brainstems, corpora callosa and optic chiasmas sliced, spliced, diced,
   iced in the name of the Scientific Method. Now Alpert was sitting on the
   floor in Perry Lane in the old boho Lotus hunker-down and exegeting very
   seriously about a baby crawling blindly about the room. Blindly? What do
   you mean, blindly? That baby is a very sentient creature . .. That baby
   sees the world with a completeness that you and I will never know again.
   His doors of perception have not yet been closed. He still experiences the
   moment he lives in. The inevitable bullshit hasn't constipated his
   cerebral cortex yet. He still sees the world as it really is, while we sit
   here, left with only a dim historical version of it manufactured for us by
   words and official bullshit, and so forth and so on, and Alpert soars in
   Ouspenskyian loop-the-loops for baby while, as far as this girl can make
   out, baby just bobbles, dribbles, lists and rocks across the floor ... But
   she was learning ... that the world is sheerly divided into those who have
   had the experience and those who have not-those who have been through that
   door and-

   It was a strange feeling for all these good souls to suddenly realize that
   right here on woody thatchy little Perry Lane, amid the honeysuckle and
   dragonflies and boughs and leaves and a thousand little places where the
   sun peeped through, while straight plodding souls from out of the Stanford
   eucalyptus tunnel plodded by straight down the fairways on the golf course
   across the way-this amazing experiment in consciousness was going on, out
   on a frontier neither they nor anybody else ever heard of before.

   PALO ALTO, CALIF., JULY 21, I963 - AND THEN ONE DAY THE end of an era, as
   the papers like to put it. A developer bought most of Perry Lane and was
   going to tear down the cottages and put up modern houses and the
   bulldozers were coming.

   The papers turned up to write about the last night on Perry Lane, noble
   old Perry Lane, and had the old cliche at the ready, End of an Era,
   expecting to find some deep-thinking latter-day Thorstein Veblen
   intellectuals on hand with sonorous bitter statements about this machine
   civilization devouring its own past.

   Instead, there were some kind of nuts out here. They were up in a tree
   lying on a mattress, all high as coons, and they kept offering everybody,
   all the reporters and photographers, some kind of venison chili, but there
   was something about the whole setup-

   and when it came time for the sentimental bitter statement, well, instead,
   this big guy Kesey dragged a piano out of his house and they all set about
   axing the hell out of it and burning it up, calling it "the oldest living
   thing on Perry Lane," only they were giggling and yahooing about it, high
   as coons, in some weird way, all of them, hard-grabbing off the stars, and
   it was hard as hell to make the End of an Era story come out right in the
   papers, with nothing but this kind of freaking Olsen & Johnson material to
   work with,

   but they managed to go back with the story they came with, End of an Era,
   the cliche intact, if they could only blot out the cries in their ears of
   Ve-ni-son Chi-li-

   -and none of them would have understood it, anyway, even if someone had
   told them what was happening. Kesey had already bought a new place in La
   Honda, California. He had already proposed to a dozen people on the Lane
   that they come with him, move the whole scene, the whole raggedy-manic
   Era, off to ...

   Versailles, his Low Rent Versailles, over the mountain and through the
   woods, in La Honda, Calif. Where-where-in the lime :::::: light :::::: and
   the neon dust-

   "... a considerable new message ... the blissful counter-stroke ..."

   A very Christmas card,

   Kesey's new place near La Honda.

   A log house, a mountain creek, a little wooden bridge

   Fifteen miles from Palo Alto beyond

   Cahill Ridge where Route 84

   Cuts through a redwood forest gorge-

   A redwood forest for a yard!

   A very Christmas card.

   And-

   Strategic privacy.

   Not a neighbor for a mile.

   La Honda lived it Western style.

   One work-a-daddy hive,

   A housing tract,

   But it was back behind the redwoods.

   The work-a-daddy faces could

   Not be seen from scenic old Route 84,

   Just a couple Wilde Weste roadside places, Baw's General Store,

   The Hilltom Motel, in the Wilde Weste Touriste mode.

   With brown wood signs sawed jagged at the ends,

   But sawed neat, you know,

   As if to suggest:

   Wilde Weste Roughing It, motoring friends,

   But Sanitized jake seats

   Ammonia pucks in every urinal

   We aim to keep your Wilde West Sani-pure-

   Who won the West?

   Antisepsis did, I guess.

   La Honda's Wilde Weste lode

   Seems to be owed to the gunslinging Younger Brothers.

   They holed up in town

   And dad-blame but they found a neighborly way

   To pay for their stay.

   They built a whole wooden store, these notorious mothers.

   But them was the Younger Brothers,

   Mere gunslingers.

   Now this Kesey

   And his Merry Humdingers down the road-

   -in the ::::: lime ::::: light :::::

   Early in 1964, just a small group on hand as yet. In the afternoon-Faye,
   the eternal beatific pioneer wife, in the house, at the stove, at the
   sewing machine, at the washing machine, with the children, Shannon and
   Zane, gathered around her skirts. Out in a wooden shack near the creek
   Kesey has his desk and typewriter where he has just finished the revisions
   on Sometimes a Great Notion, now almost 300,000 words long. Kesey's friend
   from Oregon, George Walker, is here, a blond All-American-looking guy in
   his twenties, well-built, son of a wealthy housing developer. Walker has
   what is known as a sunny disposition and is always saying Too much! in the
   most enthusiastic way. And Sandy Lehmann-Haupt. Sandy is the younger
   brother of Carl Lehmann-Haupt, whom Kesey had known on Perry Lane. Sandy
   is a handsome kid, 22 years old, tall, lean-high-strung. Sandy had met
   Kesey three months before, November 14, 1963, through Carl, when Kesey had
   come to New York for the opening of the stage version of One Flew Over the
   Cuckoo's Nest. Kirk Douglas played McMurphy. Sandy had dropped out of
   N.Y.U. and was working as a sound engineer. He was a genius with tapes,
   soundtracks, audio systems and so forth, but he was going through a bad
   time. It got to the point where one day he tried to enter himself in a
   psychiatric ward, only to be talked out of it by Carl, who took him off to
   see the opening of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. And there was Randle
   McMurphy ... Kesey ... and Carl asked Kesey to take Sandy out west with
   him, to La Honda, to get him out of the whole New York morass. And if
   there was any place for curing the New York thing, this was it, out back
   of Kesey's in the lime :::::: light :::::: bower :::::: up the path out
   back of the house, up the hill into the redwood forest, Sandy suddenly
   came upon a fabulous bower, like a great domed enclosure, like what people
   mean when they talk about a "cathedral in the pines," only the redwoods
   were even more majestic. The way the sun came down through the redwood
   leaves-trunks and leaves seemed to stretch up for hundreds of feet above
   your head. It was always sunny and cool at the same time, like a perfect
   fall day all year around. The sun came down through miles of leaves and
   got broken up like a pointillist painting, deep green and dapple shadows
   but brilliant light in a soaring deep green super-bower, a perpetual
   lime-green light, green-and-gold afternoon, stillness, perpendicular
   peace, wood-scented, with the cars going by on Route 84 just adding
   pneumatic sound effects, sheee-ooooooooo, like a gentle wind. All peace
   here; very reassuring!

   A FEW TIMES SANDY AND KESEY AND WALKER WOULD WALK UP into the forest with
   axes and cut some wood for the house-but that wasn't really the name of it
   at Kesey's. Sandy could see that Kesey wasn't primarily an outdoorsman. He
   wasn't that crazy about unspoilt Nature. It was more like he had a vision
   of the forest as a fantastic stage setting ... in which every day would be
   a happening, an art form ...

   He had hi-fi speakers up on the roof of the house, and suddenly out here
   in God's great green mountain ozone erupts a manic spade blowing on a
   plastic saxophone, namely, an Ornette Coleman record. It's a slightly
   weird path here that the three loggers take: nutty mobiles hanging from
   the low branches and a lot of wild paintings nailed up on the tree trunks.
   Then a huge tree with a hollow base, and inside it, glinting in the greeny
   dark, here is a tin horse with the tin bent so that the grotesque little
   animal is keeled over, kneeling, in bad shape.

   The terrain Kesey was most interested in, in fact, was inside the house.
   The house was made of logs, but it was more like a lodge than a cabin. The
   main room had big French doors, for a picture-window effect, and exposed
   beams and a big stone fireplace at one end. Kesey had all sorts of
   recording apparatus around, tape recorders, motion-picture cameras and
   projectors, and Sandy helped add still more, some fairly sophisticated
   relay systems and the like. Often the Perry Lane people would drive
   over-although no one had moved to La Honda so far. Ed Mc-Clanahan, Bob
   Stone, Vic Lovell, Chloe Scott, Jane Burton, Roy Seburn. Occasionally
   Kesey's brother Chuck and his cousin Dale would come down from Oregon.
   They both resembled Kesey but were smaller. Chuck was a bright quiet man.
   Casual and down-home. Dale was powerfully built and more completely
   down-home than either. Kesey was trying to develop various forms of
   spontaneous expression. They would do something like ... all lie on the
   floor and start rapping back and forth and Kesey puts a tape-recorder
   microphone up each sleeve and passes his hands through the air and over
   their heads, like a sorcerer making signs, and their voices cut in and out
   as the microphones sail over. Sometimes the results were pretty-

   -well, freaking gibberish to normal human ears, most likely. Or, to the
   receptive standard intellectual who has heard about the 1913 Armory Show
   and Erik Satie and Edgard Varese and John Cage it might sound ... sort of
   avant-garde, you know. But in fact, like everything else here, it grows
   out of... the experience, with LSD. The whole other world that LSD opened
   your mind to existed only in the moment itself-Now-and any attempt to
   plan, compose, orchestrate, write a script, only locked you out of the
   moment, back in the world of conditioning and training where the brain was
   a reducing valve .. .

   So they would try still wilder improvisations ... like the Human Tapes,
   huge rolls of butcher paper stretched out on the floor. They would take
   wax pencils, different colors, and scrawl out symbols for each other to
   improvise on: Sandy the pink drum strokes there, and he would make a sound
   like chee-oonh-chunh, chee-oonh-chunh, and so forth, and Kesey the guitar
   arrows there, broinga broinga brang brang, and Jane Burton the bursts of
   scat vocals there, and Bob Stone the Voice Over stories to the background
   of the Human Jazz-all of it recorded on the tape recorder-and then all
   soaring on-what?-acid, peyote, morning-glory seeds, which were very hell
   to choke down, billions of bilious seeds mulching out into sodden
   dandelions in your belly, bloated-but soaring!-or IT-290, or dexedrine,
   benzedrine, methedrine-Speed!-or speed and grass-sometimes you could take
   a combination of speed and grass and prop that... LSD door open in the
   mind without going through the whole uncontrollable tumult of the LSD ...
   And Sandy takes LSD and the lime :::::: light :::::: and the magical bower
   turns into... neon dust... pointillist particles for sure, now. Golden
   particles, brilliant forest-green particles, each one picking up the
   light, and all shimmering and flowing like an electronic mosaic, pure
   California neon dust. There is no way to describe how beautiful this
   discovery is, to actually see the atmosphere you have lived in for years
   for the first time and to feel that it is inside of you, too, flowing up
   from the heart, the torso, into the brain, an electric fountain ... And
   ... IT-290!-he and George Walker are up in the big tree in front of the
   house, straddling a limb, and he experiences .. . intersubjectivity-he
   knows precisely what Walker is thinking. It isn't necessary to say what
   the design is, just the part each will do.

   "You paint the cobwebs," Sandy says, "and I'll paint the leaves behind
   them."

   "Too much!" says George, because, of course, he knows-all of us sliding in
   and out of these combinations of mutual consciousness, intersubjectivity,
   going out to the backhouse, near the creek, with tape recorders and
   starting to rap-a form of free association conversation, like a jazz
   conversation, or even a monologue, with everyone, or whoever, catching
   hold of words, symbols, ideas, sounds, and winging them back and forth and
   beyond ... the walls of conventional logic ... One of us finds a bunch of
   wooden chessmen. They are carved figures, some kind of ancient men, every
   piece an old carved man, only somebody left them outside and they got wet
   and now they're warped, which sprung them open into their real selves.
   This one's genitals are hanging out despite he has robes on and carries a
   spear-

   -Have you seen my daughter? Claims I embarrass her. Claims the whole world
   knows I have cunt on the brain. At my age-

   -Yes, sir, we have the report. Your daughter's a horny little bitch, but I
   am the King and I have no choice but to cut your balls off-

   -King, I'll throw you for them-

   -Your balls?

   --Right! With those gold hubcaps you lug about there-

   -Right! In fact, incredible. Each one of us has a chess figure in his hand
   and becomes that character and they are rapping off the personalities they
   see in these figures, and they start thinking the same things at once. I,
   too, saw these funny little curves under this figure's hand here, no
   larger than the head of a tiny tack, as... golden hubcaps... I was about
   to say it-

   It is the strangest feeling of my life-intersubjectivity, as if our
   consciousnesses have opened up and flowed together and now one has only to
   look at a flicker of the other's mouth or eye or at the chessman he holds
   in his hand, wobbling-

   -You wouldn't believe a girl with electric eel tits, would you, King?

   -The ones that ionized King Arthur's sword under swamp water?

   -The very ones. Dugs with a thousand tiny suction caps, a horny, duggy
   little girl, I'm afraid, 120 household volts of jail bait if I ever saw
   one-

   -and how, in the wildest operations of chance, could a term like 120
   household volts of jail bait arise in all our minds at once-

   But the swamps, too-it is no longer all Garden of Eden and glorious
   discovery for the old Perry Lane crowd. In fact, there's a little
   grumbling here in the magic dell. Kesey is starting to organize our trips.
   He hands out the drugs personally, one for you, and I one for you ... and
   just when you're starting to lie back and groove on your thing, he comes
   in-Hup!-Hup!-Everybody up! and organizes a tramp through the woods ...

   After it's all over, some of them ask Kesey for some acid and IT-290 to
   take back to Palo Alto. No-o-o-o-o-o, says Kesey, and he cocks his head as
   if he wants to say this thing just right, because it's a delicate
   matter.-I think you should come here and take it...

   Later, on the way back, someone says: We used to be equals. Now it's
   Kesey's trip. We go to his place. We take his acid. We do what he wants.

   But what does he want? Gradually, vaguely, it dawns that Kesey's fantasy
   has moved on again, beyond even theirs, old Perry Lane. In any case,
   nobody has the stomach for Kesey's master plan, that they should all move
   out onto his place, in tents and so forth, transplanting the Perry Lane
   thing to La Honda. They began to eye Kesey's place as a kind of
   hill-country Versailles, with Kesey as the Sun King, looking bigger all
   the time, with that great jaw in profile against the redwoods and the
   mountaintops. It never develops into an open breach, however, or even
   disenchantment. They just get uneasy. They get the feeling that Kesey was
   heading out on further, toward a fantasy they didn't know if they wanted
   to explore.

   OTHER PEOPLE WERE BEGINNING TO SHOW UP AT KESEY'S, AND that was part of
   the trouble. Some of the Perry Lane crowd didn't know exactly what to make
   of Cassady. Here he is before us in Kesey's Versailles, coming on, coming
   on, with his shirt off and his arms jerking and his abdominal obliques
   jutting out at the sides like a weight lifter's . . . We are hip, we value
   the holy primitive. Only Kesey is intimating that one should learn from
   Cassady, he is talking to you. Which he was. Cassady wanted intellectual
   communion. But the intellectuals just wanted him to be the holy primitive,
   the Denver kid, the natural in our midst. Sometimes Cassady would sense
   they weren't accepting him intellectually and go off into the corner,
   still on his manic monologue, muttering, "All right, I'll take my own
   trip, I'll go off on my own trip, this is my own trip, you understand ..."

   Or Page Browning. The Cadaverous Cowboy had found his way over the
   mountain, too. Back on Perry Lane he had been just a Low Rent character
   popping in from time to time on his route. Only now Kesey is intimating
   that one can learn from Page Browning. Kesey finds something loyal, brave
   and creative, creative, under that cadaverous face and the Adam's apple
   and the black motorcycle jacket like a leftover from when he must've
   ridden with the Hell's Angels-and his thick Shellube pit voice. The
   primordial Shellube pits ... could that be it, a little class fear, after
   all, among the hip ... genteel... intellectuals? A little Ahor, as Arthur
   Koestler called it, the Ancient Horror, from boyhood-the genteel suburban
   kid rides his bicycle over to the gas station and there in the grease pit
   area where they lubricate the cars the hard rocks are hunkered down
   telling jokes about pussy, with an occasional clinical reference to bowel
   movements and crepitation. And oh christ don't you remember their forearms
   with the basilic veins wrapped around them like surgical tubes, gorged
   with the unattainable lower-class hard-rock power that any moment is going
   to look up and spot us... genteel little pudding kids. But Kesey loved
   this Low Rent stuff. He was ready to swing with it. In time he would even
   be swinging with the beasts from the veritable Ahor fathoms of the
   Shellube pits, the Hell's Angels themselves . . .

   In fact, only a few of the new retinue that showed up at La Honda were Low
   Rent in terms of background, but the place became much more down-home than
   Perry Lane.

   One of Kesey's old friends, Kenneth Babbs, showed up, just back from
   Vietnam, where he had been a captain in the Marines, flying helicopters.
   Babbs had graduated magna cum laude from Miami University, majoring in
   English. He had also been a great athlete. He entered the creative-writing
   program at Stanford, where Kesey met him. Babbs was tall, powerful, a very
   Rabelaisian creature. Back from the wars, he came on like a great hearty
   grizzly bear roaring a cosmic laugh. Sometimes he would wear a flight suit
   for days at a time, no matter where he was, come fly with me. And Babbs
   was capable of some wild flights. He gave the Kesey colony much of its new
   style ... Yes. He introduced the idea of the pranks, great public put-ons
   they could perform ...

   And Mike Hagen arrived. Hagen was a fellow Kesey had known in Oregon,
   good-looking, soft-spoken, well-mannered, from a good family, fairly rich,
   the kind of kid daddies smile over as he takes their teenage daughter out
   on her first date, Yup, I've raised her pretty damn well, if I do say so.
   No riffraff for my girl, just nice Christian boys who say Yes, sir, Yes,
   ma'am and comb their hair down with water on the comb. About ten minutes
   after Hagen pulled into Kesey's, he had his Screw Shack built out back of
   the cabin, a lean-to banged together with old boards and decorated inside
   with carpet remnants, a mattress with an India-print coverlet, candles,
   sparkling little bijoux, a hi-fi speaker-for the delight and comfort of
   Hagen's Girls. Oh christ Hagen's Girls and the trouble they caused-Stark
   Naked, Anonymous-but they come later. Hagen was a benign but inspired con
   man in a sweet way. He had a special gift for haggling, bartering,
   hassling, and Hagen would turn up with his car crammed with gleaming
   tape-recorder equipment, movie equipment, microphones, speakers,
   amplifiers, even video-tape equipment, and the audio-visual level started
   rising around here-

   Then one day, for example, one of Kesey's old Perry Lane friends, Gurney
   Norman, a writer, drove up for the weekend from Fort Ord, the Army camp,
   and brought along one of his Army friends, a 24-year-old first lieutenant
   in the infantry named Ron Bevirt. Bevirt put everybody off at first,
   because he looked totally Army. He was fat and sloppy-looking and had a
   particularly gross-looking Army crewcut and was totally unsophisticated.
   Bevirt, however, liked them and he kept coming on weekends and bringing a
   lot of food, which he enjoyed sharing with everybody, and he smiled and
   laughed a lot and people couldn't help but get to like him. By and by he
   was out of the Army and he came around all the time. He even started
   getting leaner and harder and his hair grew out until it was like Prince
   Valiant's, in the comic strip, and he was a pretty handsome guy and very
   much into the ... pudding. By and by he became known as The Hassler and
   his real name vanished almost...

   AND BY AND BY, OF COURSE, THE CITIZENS OF LA HONDA AND others would start
   wondering ... what are the ninnies doing? How to tell it? But there was no
   way to tell them about the experience. You couldn't put it into words. The
   citizens always had the same fantasy, known as the pathology fantasy.
   These ninnies are pathological. Sometimes it was psychological-what do
   these kids come from, broken homes or what? Sometimes it was social-are
   these kids alienated? is our society getting rotten at the core? or what?
   The citizens couldn't know about the LSD experience, because that door had
   never opened for them. To be on the threshold of-Christ! how to tell them
   about the life here? The Youth had always had only three options: go to
   school, get a job or live at home. And-how boring each was!-compared to
   the experience of. . . the infinite . . . and a life in which the subject
   is not scholastic or bureaucratic but... Me and Us, the attuned ones amid
   the non-musical shiny-black-shoe multitudes, /-with my eyes on that almost
   invisible hole up there in the r-r-r-redwood sky ...

   ONE NIGHT BOB STONE WAS SITTING AT HOME IN MENLO Park-he was still in the
   creative-writing program at Stanford-and the phone rang and it was Babbs
   calling from Kesey's in La Honda. Come on over, he said, we're going to
   get something going. Well, no, Stone said, he didn't feel much up to it,
   he was kind of tired and it would take an hour to drive over the mountain
   and an hour to drive back, and maybe some other time-

   "Come on, Bob," says Babbs. "It won't take you an hour. You can get here
   in thirty minutes."

   Babbs is in very high spirits and in the background Stone can hear music
   and voices and they are, indeed, getting something going.

   "I know how long it takes," says Stone. "And it takes forty-five minutes
   or an hour, more like an hour at night."

   'Listen!" says Babbs, who is laughing and practically shouting into the
   phone. "The intrepid traveler can make it in thirty minutes! The intrepid
   traveler can make it with the speed of light!"

   In the background Babbs can hear a couple of voices rapping DEGff that:
   "The intrepid traveler! The intrepid traveler!"

   "The intrepid traveler," Babbs is shouting. "The intrepid traveler just
   gets up and walks out and he's here!"

   And so on, until Stone's resistance wears down and he gets in his car and
   heads over. He arrives; after an hour, yes.

   As soon as he gets out of his car out front of the house he starts hearing
   the Big Rap, from inside the house, from up in the woods, it's like drums
   are beating and horns are blowing and Pranksters are ululating and
   rapping: "The Intrepid Traveler!"

   "The Intrepid Traveler!"

   "The Intrepid Traveler!"

   "The Intrepid Traveler!"

   "The Intrepid Traveler!"

   He goes through the French doors in the front, mad ochre and lurid lights,
   gongs, pipes, drums, guitars being banged like percussion bangers-

   "The Intrepid Traveler!"

   "The Intrepid Traveler-the traveler in a flash!"

   "The Intrepid Traveler-"

   "-straights out the curves!"

   "The Intrepid Traveler-"

   "-curves out the straights!"

   "The Intrepid Traveler-"

   "-a beam of light!"

   "The Intrepid Traveler-"

   "-a lightning beam ! "

   "The Intrepid Traveler-"

   "-shortens the circuit!"

   "The Intrepid Traveler-"

   "-short-waves the band!"

   "The Intrepid Traveler-"

   "-and his band of Merry Pranksters!"

   "The Intrepid Traveler!-"

   -and his band of Merry Pranksters take a journey to the East.

                                    chapter

                                       VI

                                    The Bus

   I couldn't tell you for sure which of the merry Pranksters got the idea
   for the bus, but it had the Babbs touch. It was a superprank, in any case.
   The original fantasy, here in the spring of 1964, had been that Kesey and
   four or five others would get a station wagon and drive to New York for
   the New York World's Fair. On the way they could shoot some film, make
   some tape, freak out on the Fair and see what happened. They would also be
   on hand, in New York, for the publication of Kesey's second novel,
   Sometimes a Great Notion, early in July. So went the original fantasy.

   Then somebody-Babbs?-saw a classified ad for a 1939 International
   Harvester school bus. The bus belonged to a man in Menlo Park. He had a
   big house and a lot of grounds and a nice set of tweeds and flannels and
   eleven children. He had rigged out the bus for the children. It had bunks
   and benches and a refrigerator and a sink for washing dishes and cabinets
   and shelves and a lot of other nice features for living on the road. Kesey
   bought it for $1,500-in the name of Intrepid Trips, Inc.

   Kesey gave the word and the Pranksters set upon it one afternoon. They
   started painting it and wiring it for sound and cutting a hole in the roof
   and fixing up the top of the bus so you could sit up there in the open air
   and play music, even a set of drums and electric guitars and electric bass
   and so forth, or just ride. Sandy went to work on the wiring and rigged up
   a system with which they could broadcast from inside the bus, with tapes
   or over microphones, and it would blast outside over powerful speakers on
   top of the bus. There were also microphones outside that would pick up
   sounds along the road and broadcast them inside the bus. There was also a
   sound system inside the bus so you could broadcast to one another over the
   roar of the engine and the road. You could also broadcast over a tape
   mechanism so that you said something, then heard your own voice a second
   later in variable lag and could rap off of that if you wanted to. Or you
   could put on earphones and rap simultaneously off sounds from outside,
   coming in one ear, and sounds from inside, your own sounds, coming in the
   other ear. There was going to be no goddamn sound on that whole trip,
   outside the bus, inside the bus, or inside your own freaking larynx, that
   you couldn't tune in on and rap off of.

   The painting job, meanwhile, with everybody pitching in in a frenzy of
   primary colors, yellows, oranges, blues, reds, was sloppy as hell, except
   for the parts Roy Seburn did, which were nice manic mandalas. Well, it was
   sloppy, but one thing you had to say for it; it was freaking lurid. The
   manifest, the destination sign in the front, read: "Furthur," with two
   u's.

   THEY TOOK A TEST RUN UP INTO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND right away this
   wild-looking thing with the wild-looking people was great for stirring up
   consternation and vague befuddling resentment among the citizens. The
   Pranksters were now out among them, and it was exhilarating-look at the
   mothers staring!-and there was going to be holy terror in the land. But
   there would also be people who would look up out of their poor
   work-a-daddy lives in some town, some old guy, somebody's stenographer,
   and see this bus and register ... delight, or just pure open-invitation
   wonder. Either way, the Intrepid Travelers figured, there was hope for
   these people. They weren't totally turned off. The bus also had great
   possibilities for altering the usual order of things. For example, there
   were the cops.

   One afternoon the Pranksters were on a test run in the bus going through
   the woods up north and a forest fire had started. There was smoke
   beginning to pour out of the woods and everything. Everybody on the bus
   had taken acid and they were zonked. The acid was in some orange juice in
   the refrigerator and you drank a paper cup full of it and you were zonked.
   Cassady was driving and barreling through the burning woods wrenching the
   steering wheel this way and that way to his inner-wired beat, with a siren
   wailing and sailing through the rhythm.

   A siren? It's a highway patrolman, which immediately seems like the
   funniest thing in the history of the world. Smoke is pouring out of the
   woods and they are all sailing through leaf explosions in the sky, but the
   cop is bugged about this freaking bus. The cop yanks the bus over to the
   side and he starts going through a kind of traffic-safety inspection of
   the big gross bus, while more and more of the smoke is billowing out of
   the woods. Man, the license plate is on wrong and there's no light over
   the license plate and this turn signal looks bad and how about the brakes,
   let's see that hand brake there. Cassady, the driver, is already into a
   long monologue for the guy, only he is throwing in all kinds of sirs:
   "Well, yes sir, this is a Hammond bi-valve serrated brake, you understand,
   sir, had it put on in a truck ro-de-o in Springfield, Oregon, had to back
   through a slalom course of baby's bottles and yellow nappies, in the
   existential culmination of Oregon, lots of outhouse freaks up there, you
   understand, sir, a punctual sort of a state, sir, yes sir, holds to 28,000
   pounds, 28,000 pounds, you just look right here, sir, tested by a
   pureblooded Shell Station attendant in Springfield, Oregon, winter of '62,
   his gumball boots never froze, you understand, sir, 28,000 pounds hold,
   right here-" Whereupon he yanks back on the hand-brake as if it's attached
   to something, which it isn't, it is just dangling there, and jams his foot
   on the regular brake, and the bus shudders as if the hand brake has a hell
   of a bite, but the cop is thoroughly befuddled now, anyway, because
   Cassady's monologue has confused him, for one thing, and what the hell are
   these... people doing. By this time everybody is off the bus rolling in
   the brown grass by the shoulder, laughing, giggling, ya-hooing, zonked to
   the skies on acid, because, mon, the woods are burning, the whole world is
   on fire, and a Cassady monologue on automotive safety is rising up from
   out of his throat like weenie smoke, as if the great god Speed were frying
   in his innards, and the cop, representative of the people of California in
   this total freaking situation, is all hung up on a hand brake that doesn't
   exist in the first place. And the cop, all he can see is a bunch of
   crazies in screaming orange and green costumes, masks, boys and girls, men
   and women, twelve or fourteen of them, lying in the grass and making
   hideously crazy sounds-christ almighty, why the hell does he have to
   contend with ... So he wheels around and says, "What are you, uh-show
   people?"

   "That's right, officer," Kesey says. "We're show people. It's been a long
   row to hoe, I can tell you, and it's gonna be a long row to hoe, but
   that's the business."

   "Well," says the cop, "you fix up those things and ..." He starts backing
   off toward his car, cutting one last look at the crazies. "... And watch
   it next time ..." And he guns on off.

   That was it! How can you give a traffic ticket to a bunch of people
   rolling in the brown grass wearing Day-Glo masks, practically Greek
   masques, only with Rat phosphorescent elan, giggling, keening in their
   costumes and private world while the god Speed sizzles like a short-order
   French fry in the gut of some guy who doesn't even stop talking to
   breathe. A traffic ticket? The Pranksters felt more immune than ever.
   There was no more reason for them to remain in isolation while the ovoid
   eyes of La Honda supurated. They could go through the face of America
   muddling people's minds, but it's a momentary high, and the bus would be
   gone, and all the Fab foam in their heads would settle back down into
   their brain pans.

   SO THE HIERONYMUS BOSCH BUS HEADED OUT OF KESEY'S place with the
   destination sign in front reading "Furthur" and a sign in the back saying
   "Caution: Weird Load." It was weird, all right, but it was euphoria on
   board, barreling through all that warm California sun in July, on the
   road, and everything they had been working on at Kesey's was on board and
   heading on Furthur. Besides, the joints were going around, and it was nice
   and high out here on the road in America. As they headed out, Cassady was
   at the wheel, and there was Kesey, Babbs, Page Browning, George Walker,
   Sandy, Jane Burton, Mike Hagen, Hassler, Kesey's brother Chuck and his
   cousin Dale, a guy known as Brother John, and three newcomers who were
   just along for the ride or just wanted to go to New York.

   One of them was a young, quite handsome kid-looked sort of like the early,
   thin Michael Caine in Zulu-named Steve Lambrecht. He was the
   brother-in-law of Kesey's lawyer, Paul Robertson, and he was just riding
   to New York to see a girl he knew named Kathy. Another was a girl named
   Paula Sundsten. She was young, plump, ebullient, and very sexy. Kesey knew
   her from Oregon. Another one was some girl Hagen of the Screw Shack had
   picked up in San Francisco, on North Beach. She was the opposite of Paula
   Sundsten. She was thin, had long dark hair, and would be moody and silent
   one minute and nervous and carrying on the next. She was good-looking like
   a TV witch.

   By the time they hit San Jose, barely 30 miles down the road, a lot of the
   atmosphere of the trip was already established. It was nighttime and many
   souls were high and the bus had broken down. They pulled into a service
   station and pretty soon one of the help has his nose down in under the
   hood looking at the engine while Cassady races the motor and the
   fluorescent stanchion lights around the station hit the bus in weird
   phosphorescent splashes, the car lights stream by on the highway, Cassady
   guns the engine some more, and from out of the bus comes a lot of weird
   wailing, over the speakers or just out the windows. Paula Sundsten has
   gotten hold of a microphone with the variable-lag setup and has found out
   she can make weird radio-spook laughing ghoul sounds with it, wailing like
   a banshee and screaming "How was your stay-ay-ay-ay ... in San
   Ho-zay-ay-ay-ay-ay," with the variable lag picking up the ay-ay-ay-ays and
   doubling them, quadrupling them, octupling them. An endless ricocheting
   echo-and all the while this weird, slightly hysterical laugh and a
   desperate little plunking mandolin sail through it all, coming from
   Hagen's girl friend, who is lying back on a bench inside, plunking a
   mandolin and laughing-in what way . ..

   Outside, some character, some local, has come over to the bus, but the
   trouble is, he is not at all impressed with the bus, he just has to do the
   American Man thing of when somebody's car is broken down you got to come
   over and make your diagnosis.

   And he is saying to Kesey and Cassady, "You know what I'd say you need?
   I'd say you need a good mechanic. Now, I'm not a good mechanic, but I-"
   And naturally he proceeds to give his diagnosis, while Paula wails, making
   spook-house effects, and the Beauty Witch keens and goons-and-

   "-like I say, what you need is a good mechanic, and I'm not a good
   mechanic, but-"

   And-of course!-the Non-people. The whole freaking world was full of people
   who were bound to tell you they weren't qualified to do this or that but
   they were determined to go ahead and do just that thing anyway. Kesey
   decided he was the Non-navigator. Babbs was the Non-doctor. The bus trip
   was already becoming an allegory of life.

                                     * * *

   BEFORE HEADING EAST, OUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THEY stopped at Babbs's place
   in San Juan Capistrano, down below Los Angeles. Babbs and his wife Anita
   had a place down there. They pulled the bus into Babbs's garage and sat
   around for one final big briefing before taking off to the east.

   Kesey starts talking in the old soft Oregon drawl and everybody is quiet.

   "Here's what I hope will happen on this trip," he says. "What I hope will
   continue to happen, because it's already starting to happen. All of us are
   beginning to do our thing, and we're going to keep doing it, right out
   front, and none of us are going to deny what other people are doing."

   "Bullshit," says Jane Burton.

   This brings Kesey up short for a moment, but he just rolls with it.

   "That's Jane," he says. "And she's doing her thing. Bullshit. That's her
   thing and she's doing it."

   "None of us are going to deny what other people are doing. If saying
   bullshit is somebody's thing, then he says bullshit. If somebody is an
   ass-kicker, then that's what he's going to do on this trip, kick asses.
   He's going to do it right out front and nobody is going to have anything
   to get pissed off about. He can just say, 'I'm sorry I kicked you in the
   ass, but I'm not sorry I'm an ass-kicker. That's what I do, I kick people
   in the ass.' Everybody is going to be what they are, and whatever they
   are, there's not going to be anything to apologize about. What we are,
   we're going to wail with on this whole trip."

   HAUL ASS, AND WHAT WE ARE, OUT ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST, and all of it on film
   and on tape. Refrigerator, stove, a sink, bunk racks, blankets, acid,
   speed, grass-with Hagen handling the movie camera and everybody on
   microphones and the music blaring out over the roar of the bus, rock 'n'
   roll, Jimmy Smith. Cassady is revved up like they've never seen him
   before, with his shirt off, a straw version of a cowboy hat on his head,
   bouncing up and down on the driver's seat, shifting gears-doubledy-clutch,
   doubledy-clutch, blamming on the steering wheel and the gearshift box,
   rapping over the microphone rigged up by his seat like a manic tour guide,
   describing every car going by,

   "-there's a barber going down the highway cutting his hair at 500 miles an
   hour, you understand-"

   "So remember those expressions, sacrifice, glorious and in vain!" Babbs
   says.

   "Food! Food! Food!" Hagen says.

   "Get out the de-glom ointment, sergeant!" says Babbs, rapping at Steve
   Lambrecht. "The only cure for joint glom, gets the joint off the lip in
   instant De-Glom-"

   -and so on, because Steve always has a joint glommed onto his lip and, in
   fact, gets higher than any man alive, on any and all things one throws his
   way, and picks up the name Zonker on this trip-

   "-De-Glom for the Zonker!-"

   -and then Babbs parodies Cassady-

   "-and there's a Cadillac with Marie Antoinette-"

   -and the speakers wail, and the mandolin wails and the ! weird laugh
   wails, and the variable lag wails-ails-ails-ails-ails-ails, and
   somebody-who?-hell, everybody wails,

   "-we're finally beginning to move, after three fucking days!"

   ON THE SECOND DAY THEY REACHED WIKIEUP, AN OLD WILD West oasis out in the
   Arizona desert along Route 60. It was all gray-brown desert and sun and
   this lake, which was like a huge slimy kelp pond, but the air was
   fantastic. Sandy felt great. Then Kesey held the second briefing. They
   were going to take their first acid of the trip here and have their first
   major movie production. He and Babbs and the gorgeous sexy Paula Sundsten
   were going to take acid-Wikieup!-and the others were going to record what
   happened. Hagen and Walker were going to film it, Sandy was going to
   handle the sound, and Ron Bevirt was going to take photographs.

   Sandy feels his first twinge of-what? Like ... there is going to be
   Authorized Acid only. And like ... they are going to be separated into
   performers and workers, stars and backstage. Like . .. there is an inner
   circle and an outer circle. This was illogical, because Hagen and Walker,
   certainly, were closer to Kesey than any other Pranksters besides Babbs,
   and they were "workers," too, but that was the way he feels. But he
   doesn't say anything. Not... out front.

   Kesey and Babbs and Paula hook down some acid orange juice from the
   refrigerator and wait for the vibrations. Paula is in a hell of a great
   mood. She has never taken LSD before, but she looks fearless and immune
   and ready for all, and she hooks down a good slug of it. They wait for the
   vibrations ... and here they come.

   Babbs has a big cane, a walking stick, and he is waving it around in the
   air, and the three of them, Babbs, Kesey and Paula, go running and kicking
   and screaming toward the lake and she dives in-and comes up with her head
   covered in muck and great kelpy strands of green pond slime-and beaming in
   a way that practically radiates out over the face of the lake and the
   desert. She has surfaced euphoric-

   "Oooooh! It sparkles!"

   -pulling her long strands of slime-slithering hair outward with her hands
   and grokking and freaking over it-

   "Ooooooooh! It sparkles!"

   -the beads of water on her slime strands are like diamonds to her, and
   everybody feels her feeling at once, even Sandy-

   "Oooooooooh! It sparkles!"

   -surfaced euphoric! euphorically garlanded in long greasy garlands of pond
   slime, the happiest slime freak in the West-

   -and Babbs is euphoric for her-

   Gretchen Fetchin the Slime Queen!" he yells and waves his cane at the sky.

   "Ooooooooh! It sparkles!"

   "Gretchen Fetchin the Slime Queen!"

   "It sparkles!"

   "Gretchen Fetchin!"

   And it is beautiful. Everybody goes manic and euphoric like a vast contact
   high, like they have all suddenly taken acid themselves. Kesey is in an
   athletic romp, tackling the ferns and other slimy greenery in the lake.
   Babbs and Paula-Gretchen Fetchin!-are yahooing at the sky. Hagen is
   feverishly filming it all, Sandy has a set of huge cables stretched out to
   the very edge of the lake, picking up the sound, Ron Bevirt is banging
   away with his camera. Babbs and Paula-Gretchen Fetchin!-and Kesey keep
   plunging out into the mucky innards of the lake.

   "Come back!" Hagen the cameraman starts yelling. "You're out of range ! "

   But Babbs and Paula and Kesey can't hear him. They are cartwheeling
   further and further out into the paradise muck-

   "It sparkles!"

   "Gretchen Fetchin-Queen of the Slime!"

   But meanwhile Hagen's Beauty Witch, in the contagion of the moment, has
   slipped to the refrigerator and taken some acid, and now she is outside of
   the bus on the desert sand wearing a black snakeskin blouse and a black
   mantle, with her long black hair coming down over it like in a
   pre-Raphaelite painting and a cosmic grin on her witch-white face, lying
   down on the desert, striking poses and declaiming in couplets. She's
   zonked out of her nut, but it's all in wild manic Elizabethan couplets:

   "Methinks you need a gulp of grass

   And so it quickly came to pass

   You fell to earth with eely shrieking,

   Wooing my heart, freely freaking!"

   -and so forth. Well, she wins Hagen's manic heart right away, and soon he
   has wandered off from the Lake of the Slime Euphoria and is in a
   wide-legged stance over her with the camera as she lies declaiming on the
   desert floor, camera zeroed in on her like she is Maria Montez in a love
   scene-and now the Beauty Witch is off on her trip for good . . .

   BACK ON THE BUS AND OFF FOR PHOENIX IN THE SLIME-Euphoric certitude that
   they and the movie-The Movie!- many allegories of life-that they could not
   miss now. Hagen pressed on with the film, hour after hour in the bouncing
   innards of the bus. There were moments in the History of Film that broke
   everybody up. One was when they reached Phoenix. This was during the 1964
   election excitement and they were in Barry Goldwater's home town, so they
   put a streamer on the bus reading: "A Vote for Barry is a Vote for Fun."
   And they put American flags up on the bus and Cassady drove the bus
   backward down the main drag of Phoenix while Hagen recorded it on film and
   the flags flew backward in the wind-stream. The citizens were suitably
   startled, outraged, delighted, nonplused, and would wheel around and start
   or else try to keep their cool by sidling glances like they weren't going
   to be impressed by any weird shit-and a few smiled in a frank way as if to
   say, I am with you-if only I could be with you!

   The fact that they were all high on speed or grass, or so many
   combinations thereof that they couldn't keep track, made it seem like a
   great secret life. It was a great secret life. The befuddled citizens
   could only see the outward manifestations of the incredible stuff going on
   inside their skulls. They were all now characters in their own movies or
   the Big Movie. They took on new names and used them.

   Steve Lambrecht was Zonker. Cassady was Speed Limit. Kesey was
   Swashbuckler. Babbs was Intrepid Traveler. Hagen, bouncing along with the
   big camera, soaring even while the bus roared, was Mai Function. Ron
   Bevirt had charge of all the equipment, the tools, wires, jacks, and
   stuff, and became known as Equipment Hassler, and then just Hassler.
   George Walker was Hardly Visible. And Paula Sundsten became ... Gretchen
   Fetchin the Slime Queen, of course ...

   A notebook!-for each of the new characters in The Movie, a plain child's
   notebook, and each character in this here movie can write in his notebook
   himself or other people can pick up the notebook and write in it-who knows
   who wrote what?-and in Gretchen Fetchin it says:

   Bury them in slime!

   She cried, flailing about the garden-

   With a sprig of parsley clutched in

   her hands-which had always been

   clamped in her hands.

   This is strange business,

   Gets weirder all the time,

   She said, wrapping some around

   her finger, for we are always

   moist in her hand ... "Naturally," she

   said, "The roots are deep."

   That was no surprise, but she

   was mildly curious to

   know what the hell is

   THAT

   Whereupon he got very

   clumsy, giggled confidentially,

   and tripped over her shadow,

   carrying them both into

   an unaccountable adventure.

   Barely a week out and already beautiful ebullient sexy Gretchen Fetchin
   the Slime Queen, Gretch, is synched in. Kesey, the very Swashbuckler
   himself, makes a play for her, and that should be that, but she looks
   at-Babbs-who tripped over her

   shadow?-Hmmmmmmmm? So many shadows and shafts of Southwest sun bouncing in
   through the windows and all over the floor, over the benches over the bunk
   uprights bouncing out of the freaking roar of the engine bouncing two sets
   of Gretch eyes two sets of Babbs eyes, four sets of Gretch eyes four sets
   of Babbs eyes eight sets of Gretch eyes eight sets of Babbs eyes all
   grinning vibrating bouncing in among one another carrying them both into
   an unaccountable adventure, you understand. Kesey sulks a bit-Kesey
   himself-but the sulk bounces and breaks up into Southwestern sunballs.
   Drivin' on dirt in Utah, a '46 Plymouth with an overhead cam, says
   Cassady. The refrigerator door squeaks open, gurgle gurgle, this acid O.J.
   makes a body plumb smack his lips, Hagen and his Black Witch girl friend
   hook down a cup of acid orange juice apiece and Hagen's sweet face
   spirals, turning sweet Christian boy clockwise and sweet sly Screw Shack
   counterclockwise, back and forth, and they disappear, bouncing, up the
   ladder, up through the turret hole and onto the roof where, under the
   mightily hulking sun of the Southwest and 70 miles an hour-Pretty soon
   Hagen is climbing back down the ladder and heading for the refrigerator
   and hooking down another cup of orange juice and smiling for all,
   Christian boy and Screw Shack sly, spiraling this way and that way-and
   climbing back up top the bus in order to-

   MALFUNCTION!

   If only I had $10, then we

   could split 1/2  a Ritalin order

   with Margo-I eat

   Ritalin like aspirin

   Now, let's charm Brooks Brothers-

   impressed?

   At night the goddamn bus still bouncing and the Southwest silvery blue
   coming in not exactly bouncing but slipping and sliding in shafts, sickly
   shit, and car beams and long crazy shadows from car beams sliding in weird
   bends over the inside, over the love bunk. The love bunk'll get you if you
   don't wash out. One shelf on the bunk has a sleeping bag on it and into
   this sleeping bag crawl whoever wants to make it, do your thing, bub, and
   right out front, and wail with it, and Sandy looks over and he can see a
   human . . . bobbing up and down in the sleeping bag with the car beams
   sliding over it and the motor roaring, the fabulous love bunk, and
   everyone-synch-can see that sleeping bag veritably filling up with sperm,
   the little devils swimming like mad in there in the muck, oozing into the
   cheap hairy shit they quilt the bag with, millions billions trillions of
   them, darting around, crafty little flagellants, looking to score, which
   is natural, and if any certified virgin on the face of the earth crawled
   into that sleeping bag for a nap after lunch she would be a hulking
   knocked-up miracle inside of three minutes-but won't this goddamn bouncing
   ever stop-

   THIS BEING A SCHOOL BUS, AND NOT A GREYHOUND, THE springs and the shock
   absorbers are terrible and the freaking grinding straining motor shakes it
   to pieces and hulking vibrations synched in to no creature on earth keep
   batting everybody around on the benches and the bunks. It is almost
   impossible to sleep and the days and nights have their own sickly cycle,
   blinding sun all day and the weird car beams and shadows sliding sick and
   slow at night and all the time the noise. Jane Burton is nauseous
   practically the whole time. Nobody can sleep so they keep taking more
   speed to keep going, psychic energizers like Ritalin, anything, and then
   smoke more grass to take the goddamn tachycardiac edge off the speed, and
   acid to make the whole thing turn into something else. Then it all starts
   swinging back and forth between grueling battering lurching flogging along
   the highway-and unaccountable delays, stopped, unendurable frustration by
   the side of the road in the middle of nowhere while the feeling of
   no-sleep starts turning the body and the skull into a dried-out husk
   inside with a sour greasy smoke like a tenement fire curdling in the
   brainpan. They have to pull into gasoline stations to go to the bathroom,
   cop a urination or an egestion-keep regular, friends-but 12-how many,
   14?-did we lose somebody-did we pick up somebody-climbing out of this bus,
   which is weird-looking for a start, but all these weird people are too
   much, clambering out-the service station attendant and his Number One Boy
   stare at this-Negro music is blaring out of the speakers and these weird
   people clamber out, half of them in costume, lurid shirts with red and
   white stripes, some of them with weird paint on their faces, like
   comic-book Indians, with huge circles under their eyes, eyes red, noses
   not blue, not nearly blue enough, but eyes red-all trooping out toward the
   Clean Rest Rooms, already queuing up, practically-

   "Wait a minute," the guy says. "What do you think you're doing?

   "Fill 'er up!" says Kesey, very soft and pleasant. "Yes, sir, she's a big
   bus and she takes a lotta gas. Yep."

   "I mean what are they doing?"

   "Them? I 'spect they're going to the bathroom. Ay-yup, that big old
   thing's the worst gas-eater you ever saw"-all the time motioning to Hagen
   to go get the movie camera and the microphone.

   "Well, can't all those people use the bathrooms."

   "All they want to do is go to the bathroom"-and now Kesey takes the
   microphone and Hagen starts shooting the film-whirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr-but
   all very casual as if, well, sure, don't you record it all, every last
   morsel of friendly confrontation whenever you stop on the great American
   highway to cop a urination or two? or a dozen?

   "Well, now, listen! You ain't using the bathrooms! You hear me, now! You
   see that motel back there? I own that motel, too, and we got one septic
   tank here, for here and there, and you're not gonna overflow it for me.
   Now git that thing out of my face!"

   -Kesey has the microphone in the guy's face, like this is all for the six
   o'clock news, and then he brings the microphone back to his face, just
   like the TV interview shows, and says,

   "You see that bus out there? Every time we stop to fill 'er up we have to
   lay a whole lot of money on somebody, and we'd like it to be you, on
   account of your hospitality."

   "It's an unaccountable adventure in consumer spending," says Babbs.

   "Get those cameras and microphones out of here," the guy says. "I'm not
   afraid of you!"

   "I should hope not," says Kesey, still talking soft and down-home. "All
   that money that big baby's gonna drink up. Whew!"

   Sheerooooooo-all this time the toilets are flushing, this side and that
   side and the noise of it roars and gurgles right through the cinder block
   walls until it sounds like there's nothing in the whole wide open U.S. of
   A. except for Clean Rest Room toilets and Day-Glo crazies and cameras and
   microphones from out of nowhere, and the guy just caves in under it. He
   can't fit it into his movie of Doughty American Entrepreneur-not no kind
   of way-

   "Well, they better make it fast or there's going to be trouble around
   here." And he goes out to fill 'er up, this goddamn country is going down
   the drain.

   But they don't speed it up. Walker is over to the coin telephone putting
   in a call to Faye back in La Honda. Babbs is clowning around out on the
   concrete apron of the gas station with Gretchen Fetchin. Jane Burton feels
   bilious-the idea is to go to New York, isn't it? even on a 1939 school bus
   it could be done better than this. What are we waiting, waiting, waiting,
   waiting for, playing games with old crocks at gas stations. Well, we're
   waiting for Sandy, for one thing. Where in the hell is Sandy. But Sandy-he
   hasn't slept in days and he has an unspecific urge to get off the bus-but
   not to sleep, just to get off-for-what?-be-fore:::::what? And Sandy is
   back over at the motel, inspecting this electropink slab out in the middle
   of nowhere-somebody finally finds him and brings him back. Sandy is given
   the name Dismount in the great movie.

   "There are going to be times," says Kesey, "when we can't wait for
   somebody. Now, you're either on the bus or off the bus. If you're on the
   bus, and you get left behind, then you'll find it again. If you're off the
   bus in the first place-then it won't make a damn." And nobody had to have
   it spelled out for them. Everything was becoming allegorical, understood
   by the group mind, and especially this: "You're either on the bus ... or
   off the bus."

   EXCEPT FOR HAGEN'S GIRL, THE BEAUTY WITCH. IT SEEMS LIKE she never even
   gets off the bus to cop a urination. She's sitting back in the back of the
   bus with nothing on, just a blanket over her lap and her legs wedged back
   into the corner, her and her little bare breasts, silent, looking
   exceedingly witch-like. Is she on the bus or off the bus? She has taken to
   wearing nothing but the blanket and she sheds that when she feels like it.
   Maybe that is her thing and she is doing her thing and wailing with it and
   the bus barrels on off, heading for Houston, Texas, and she becomes Stark
   Naked in the great movie, one moment all conked out, but with her eyes
   open, staring, the next laughing and coming on, a lively Stark Naked, and
   they are all trying to just snap their fingers to it but now she is
   getting looks that have nothing to do with the fact that she has not a
   thing on, hell, big deal, but she is now waxing extremely freaking ESP.
   She keeps coming up to somebody who isn't saying a goddamn thing and
   looking into his eyes with the all-embracing look of total acid
   understanding, our brains are one brain, so let's visit, you and I, and
   she says: 'Ooooooooh, you really think  that, I know what you mean, but do
   you-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-ueeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"-finishing off in a sailing
   tremulo laugh as if she has just read your brain and !t is the weirdest of
   the weird shit ever, your brain eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-

   STARK-NAKED

   in a black blanket-

   Reaching out for herself,

   she woke up one morning to

   find herself accosted on all

   sides by LARGE

   MEN

   surrounding her threatening her

   with their voices, their presence, their always

   desire reaching inside herself

   and touching her obscenely upon her

   desire and causing her to laugh

   and

   LAUGH

   with the utter

   ridiculousness

   of it. . .

   -but no one denied her a moment of it, neither the conked-out bug-eyed
   paranoia nor the manic keening coming on, nobody denied her, and she could
   wail, nobody tried to cool that inflamed brain that was now seeping out
   Stark Naked into the bouncing goddamn-stop it!-currents of the bus
   throgging and roaring 70 miles an hour into Texas, for it was like it had
   been ordained, by Kesey himself, back in San Juan Capistrano, like there
   was to be a reaction scale in here, from negative to positive, and no one
   was to rise up negative about anything, one was to go positive with
   everything-go with the flow-everyone's cool was to be tested, and to shout
   No, no matter what happened, was to fail. And hadn't Kesey passed the test
   first of all? Hadn't Babbs taken Gretchen Fetchin, and did he come back at
   either one of them uptight over that? And wasn't it Walker who was calling
   La Honda from the Servicenters of America? All true, and go with the flow.
   And they went with the flow, the whole goddamn flow of America. The bus
   barrels into the superhighway toll stations and the microphones on top of
   the bus pick up all the clacking and ringing and the mumbling by the
   toll-station attendant and the brakes squeaking and the gears shifting,
   all the sounds of the true America that are screened out everywhere else,
   it all came amplified back inside the bus, while Hagen's camera picked up
   the faces, the faces in Phoenix, the cops, the service-station owners, the
   stragglers and the strugglers of America, all laboring in their movie, and
   it was all captured and kept, piling up, inside the bus. Barreling across
   America with the microphones picking it all up, the whole roar, and
   microphone up top gets eerie in a great rush and then skakkkkkkkkhkkk it
   is ripping and roaring over asphalt and thok  it's gone, no sound at all.
   The microphone has somehow ripped loose on top of the bus and hit the
   roadway and dragged along until it snapped off entirely-and Sandy can't
   believe it. He keeps waiting for somebody to tell Cassady to stop and go
   back and get the microphone, because this was something Sandy had rigged
   up with great love and time, it was his thing, his part of the power-but
   instead they are all rapping and grokking over the sound it
   made-"Wowwwwwwwww! Did you-wowwwwwww"-as if they had synched into a
   never-before-heard thing, a unique thing, the sound of an object, a
   microphone, hitting the American asphalt, the open road at 70 miles an
   hour, like if it was all there on tape they would have the instant, the
   moment, of any thing, anyone ripped out of the flow and hitting the Great
   Superhighway at 70 miles an hour-and they had it on tape-and played it
   back in variable lag skakkkkkk-akkkk-akkkk-akkkoooooooooooo.

   oooooooooooooooooooooooo-Stark Naked waxing weirder and weirder, huddled
   in the black blanket shivering, then out, bobbing wraith, her little deep
   red aureola bobbing in the crazed vibrations-finally they pull into
   Houston and head for Larry McMurtry's house. They pull up to McMurtry's
   house, in the suburbs, and the door of the house opens and out comes
   McMurtry, a slight, slightly wan, kindly-looking shy-looking guy, ambling
   out, with his little boy, his son, and Cassady opens the door of the bus
   so everybody can get off, and suddenly Stark Naked shrieks out: "Frankie!
   Frankie! Frankie! Frankie!"- this being the name of her own divorced-off
   little boy-and she whips off the blanket and leaps off the bus and out
   into the suburbs of Houston, Texas, stark naked, and rushes up to
   McMurtry's little boy and scoops him up and presses him to her skinny
   breast, crying and shrieking, "Frankie! oh Frankie! my little Frankie! oh!
   oh! oh!"-while McMurtry doesn't know what in the name of hell to do,
   reaching tentatively toward her stark-naked shoulder and saying, "Ma'am!
   Ma'am! Just a minute, ma'am!"-

   -while the Pranksters, spilling out of the bus-stop. The bus is stopped.
   No roar, no crazed bounce or vibrations, no crazed car beams, no tapes, no
   microphones. Only Stark Naked, with somebody else's little boy in her
   arms, is bouncing and vibrating.

   And there, amid the peaceful Houston elms on Quenby Road, it dawned on
   them all that this woman-which one of us even knows her?-had completed her
   trip. She had gone with the flow. She had gone stark raving mad.

                                    chapter

                                      VII

                               Unauthorized Acid

   Stark naked; stark naked; silence; but, well . . . That this or a couple
   of other crackups in the experience of the Pranksters had anything to do
   with that goofy baboon, Dope, was something that didn't cross the minds of
   the Pranksters at that point. Craziness was not an absolute. They had all
   voluntarily embarked upon a trip and a state of consciousness that was
   "crazy" by ordinary standards. The trip, in fact the whole deal, was a
   risk-all balls-out plunge into the unknown, and it was assumed merely that
   more and more of what was already inside a person would come out and
   expand, gloriously or otherwise. Stark Naked had done her thing. She
   roared off into the void and was picked up by the cops by and by, and the
   doors closed in the County psychiatric ward, and that was that, for the
   Pranksters were long gone.

   The trip had started out as a great bursting forth out of the forest
   fastness of La Honda, out into an unsuspecting America. And for Sandy,
   anyway, that was when the trip went best, when the Pranksters were out
   among them, and the citizens of the land were gawking and struggling to
   summon up the proper emotion for this-what in the name of God are the
   ninnies doing. But the opposite was happening, too. On those long
   stretches of American superhighway between performances the bus was like a
   pressure cooker, a crucible, like one of those chambers in which the early
   atomic scientists used to compress heavy water, drive the molecules closer
   and closer together until the very atoms exploded. On the bus all traces
   of freakiness or competition or bitterness or whatever were intensified.
   They were right out front, for sure.

   Jane Burton, who was now known as Generally Famished, and
   Sandy-Dis-mount-took to going off whenever they could, like in Houston,
   for a square meal. Square on every level, Tonto. They would just go right
   into one of those Square American steak houses with the big plate-glass
   window with the corny little plastic windmill in the window advertising
   Heineken's Beer and the Diners Club and American Express stickers on the
   plate-glass door and go in and have a square steak and square French fries
   and boiled bland peas and carrots and A-l sauce. Jane, now ravaged from
   lack of sleep, and ravenously hungry, generally famished, or slightly
   bilious the whole time, wondering what the hell they were now doing on the
   southern rim of the United States when New York was way up there.
   Sandy-with this subliminal urge to get off the bus, and yet be on the
   bus-on that level-and neither of them knowing what to make of Kesey-always
   Kesey ...

   AND THE HEAT. FROM HOUSTON THEY HEADED EAST THROUGH the Deep South, and
   the Deep South in July was ... lava. The air rushing into the open windows
   of the bus came in hot and gritty like invisible smoke, and when they
   stopped, it just rolled over them, pure lava. The rest in Houston didn't
   do too much good, because the heat just started it all again, nobody
   slept, and it was like all you could do to cut through the lava with speed
   and grass and acid.

   New Orleans was a relief, because they got out and walked around the
   French Quarter and down by the docks in their red and white striped shirts
   and Day-Glo stuff and the people freaked over them. And the cops came
   while they were down by the docks, which was just comic relief, because by
   now the cops were a piece of cake. The city cops were no more able to keep
   their Cop Movie going than the country cops. Hassler talked sweet to them
   like the college valedictorian and Kesey talked sweet and down-home and
   Hagen filmed it all like this was some crazed adventure in cinema verite
   and the cops skedaddled in a herd of new Ford cruisers with revolving
   turret lights. Sayonara, you all.

   They just kept walking around New Orleans in their striped shirts and
   wearing shorts, and they could all see Kesey's big muscular legs, like a
   football player's, striding on up ahead like he owned the place, like they
   all owned the place, and everybody's spirits picked up. So they head out
   to Lake Pontchartrain, on the northern edge of New Orleans. They all took
   acid, but a small dose, about 75 micrograms-everybody happy and high on
   acid, and rock 'n' roll records blaring, Martha and the Vandellas and
   Shirley Ellis, all that old stuff pounding away. Lake Pontchartrain is
   like a great big beautiful spacious-space!-park on the water. They pull
   the bus up in a parking area and there are nice trees round and all that
   endless nice water and they put on their bathing suits. Walker, who has a
   hell of a build, puts on a pair of red, yellow, and black trunks, and
   Kesey, who has a hell of a build, puts on a pair of blue and white trunks,
   and Zonker, who has a hell of a build, only leaner, puts on a pair of
   orange trunks, and the blue of the water and the scorched-out green of the
   grass and the leaves and-a little breeze?-it is all swimming in front of
   their old acid eyes like a molten postcard-water! What they don't know is,
   it is a segregated beach, for Negroes only. The spades all sitting there
   on benches sit there staring at these white crazies coming out of a weird
   bus and heading for New Or-leans 30th-parallel Deep South segregated
   water. Zonker is really zonked this time, and burning up with the heat,
   about 100 degrees, and he dives in and swims out a ways and pretty soon he
   sees he is surrounded by deep orange men, Negroes, all treading water
   around him and giving him rotten looks. One of them has a gold tooth in
   the front with a star cut out in it, so that a white enamel star shows in
   the middle of the gold, and the gold starts flashing out at him in the
   sun-cheeeakkk-in time with his heartbeat which is getting faster all the
   time, these goddamn flashes of gold and white star after-images, and the
   Golden Mouth says, "Man, there sure is a lotta trash in the water today."

   "You ain't shittin', man," says another one of them.

   "Lotta fuckin' trash, man," says another one, and so on.

   Suddenly Golden Mouth is speaking straight to Zonker: "What's all this
   trash doing in the water, man?"

   Zonker is very nonplused, partly because the whole day has turned orange
   on him, because of the acid-orange trunks, orange water, orange sky,
   orange menacing spades.

   "Boy, what you doing here!" Golden Mouth says very sharp all of a sudden.
   Orange and big and orange hulking fat back big as an orange manta ray.
   "Boy, you know what we gonna do? We gonna cut yo' little balls off. We
   gonna take you up on that beach and wail with you!"

   "Heh-hehhhhhhhhhhhh!" The others start this wailing moaning laugh.

   For some reason, however, this makes Zonker smile. He can feel it
   spreading across his face, like a big orange slice of orange sugar-jelly
   candy and he is suspended there treading water and grinning while the
   Golden Mouth flashes and flashes and flashes.

   Then the Golden Mouth says, "Well, it sure is some kinda trash," and
   starts laughing, only amiably this time, and they all laugh, and Zonker
   laughs and swims back to shore.

   By this time a big crowd of Negroes has gathered around the mad bus. Funky
   music is blasting off the speakers, a Jimmy Smith record. Zonker gets on
   the bus. It seems like thousands of Negroes are dancing around the bus,
   doing rock dances and the dirty boogie. Everything is orange and then he
   looks at the writhing mass of Negroes, out every window, nothing but
   writhing Negroes mashed in around the bus and writhing, and it all starts
   turning from orange to brown. Zonker starts getting the feeling he is
   inside an enormous intestine and it is going into peristaltic
   contractions. He can feel the whole trip turning into a horrible bummer.
   Even Kesey, who isn't afraid of anything, looks worried. "We better get
   out of here," Kesey says. But squeezed out?-in bummer brown peristaltic
   contractions? Luckily for Zonker, maybe for everybody, the white cops turn
   up at that point and break up the crowd and tell the white crazies to
   drive on, this is a segregated beach, and for once they don't pile out and
   try to break up the Cop Movie. They go with the Cop Movie and get their
   movie out of there.

   ON INTO THE FLATLANDS OF MISSISSIPPI AND ALABAMA, Biloxi, Mobile, U.S.
   Route 90, the flatlands and the fields and the heat doesn't let up ever.
   They are heading for Florida. Sandy hasn't slept in days:::::how
   many:::::like total insomnia and everything is bending in curvy curdling
   lines. Sun and flatlands. So damned hot-and everything is getting torn
   into opposites. The dead-still heat-stroked summertime deep Southland-and
   Sandy's heart racing at a constant tachycardia and his brain racing and
   reeling out and so essential to... keep moving, Cassady!... but there are
   two Cassadys. One minute Cassady looks 58 and crazy-speed!-and the next,
   28 and peaceful-acid-and Sandy can tell the peaceful Cassady in an
   instant, because his nose becomes... long and smooth and almost patrician,
   whereas the wild Cassady looks beat-up. And Kesey-always Kesey! Sandy
   looks. .. and Kesey is old and haggard and his face is lopsided ... and
   then Sandy looks and Kesey is young, serene, and his face is lineless, and
   round and smooth as a baby's as he sits for hours on end reading comic
   books, absorbed in the plunging purple Steve Ditko shadows of Dr. Strange
   attired in capes and chiaroscuro, saying: "How could they have known that
   this gem was merely a device to bridge dimensions! It was a means to enter
   the dread purple dimension-from our own world!" Sandy may wander .. . off
   the bus, but it remains all Kesey. Dr. Strange! Always seeing two Keseys.
   Kesey the Prankster and Kesey the organizer. Going through the steams of
   southern Alabama in late June and Kesey rises up from out of the comic
   books and becomes Captain Flag. He puts on a pink kilt, like a miniskirt,
   and pink socks and patent-leather shoes and pink sunglasses and wraps an
   American flag around his head like a big turban and holds it in place with
   an arrow through the back of it and gets up on top of the bus roaring
   through Alabama and starts playing the flute at people passing by. The
   Alabamans drawn into the PINK DIMENSION do a double-freak take for sure
   and it is Too Much! as George Walker always says, too mullyfogging much.
   They pull into a gas station in Mobile and half the Pranksters jump out of
   the bus, blazing red and white stripes and throwing red rubber balls
   around in a crazed way like a manic ballet of slick Servicenter flutter
   decoration while the guy fills up the tank, and he looks from them to
   Captain Flag to the bus itself, and after he collects for the gas he looks
   through the window at Cassady in the driver's seat and shakes his head and
   says:

   "No wonder you're so nigger-heavy in California."
   FORNIA-FORNIA-FORNIA-FORNIA-FORNIA-FOR-NIA-FORNIA-FORNIA as it picked up
   inside the bus in variable lag, and that breaks everybody up.

   That was when it was good ... grinding on through Alabama, and then
   suddenly, to Sandy, Kesey is old and haggard and the organizer. Sandy can
   see him descending the ladder down from the roof of the bus and glowering
   at him, and he knows-intersubjectivity!-that Kesey is thinking. You're too
   detached, Sandy, you're not out front, you may be sitting right here
   grinding and roaring through Alabama but you're ... off the bus ... And he
   approaches Sandy, hunched over under the low ceiling of the bus, and to
   Sandy he looks like an ape with his mighty arms dangling, like The
   Incredible Hulk, and suddenly Sandy jumps up and crouches into an ape
   position, dangling his arms and mimicking him-and Kesey breaks into a big
   grin and throws his arms around Sandy and hugs him-

   He approves! Kesey approves of me! At last I have responded to something,
   brought it all out front, even if it is resentment, done something, done
   my thing-and in that very action, just as he taught, it is gone, the
   resentment... and I am back on the bus again, synched in .. .

   Always Kesey! And in that surge of euphoria-Kesey approves!-Sandy knew
   that Kesey was the key to whatever was going right and whatever was going
   wrong on this trip, and nobody, not one of them who ever took this trip,
   got in this movie, would ever have even the will to walk up to Kesey and
   announce irrevocably: I am off the bus. It would be like saying, I am off
   this... Unspoken Thing we are into ...

   PENSACOLA, FLORIDA. 110 DEGREES. A FRIEND OF BABBS HAS A little house near
   the ocean, and they pull in there, but the ocean doesn't help at all. The
   heat makes waves in the air, like over a radiator. Most of the Pranksters
   are in the house or out in the yard. Some of the girls are outside the bus
   barbecuing some meat. Sandy is by himself inside the bus, in the shade.
   The insomnia is killing him. He has got to get some sleep or keep moving.
   He can't stand it in here stranded in between with his heart pounding. He
   goes to the refrigerator and takes out the orange juice. The acid in New
   Orleans, the 75 micrograms, wasn't enough. It's like he hasn't had a good
   high the whole trip, nothing ... blissful. So he hooks down a big slug of
   Unauthorized Acid and sits back.

   He would like something nice and peaceful, closed in softly alone on the
   bus. He puts on a set of earphones. The left earphone is hooked into a
   microphone inside the house and picks up Kesey's cousin Dale playing the
   piano. Dale, for all his country ways, has studied music a long time and
   plays well and the notes come in like liquid drops of amethyst vibrating
   endlessly in the . .. acid . . . atmosphere and it is very nice. The right
   earphone is hooked into a microphone picking up the sounds outside the
   house, mainly the barbecue fires crackling. So Dale concerto and fire
   crackling in these big padded earphones closed in about his head ... only
   the sounds are somehow sliding out of control. There is no synch. It is as
   if the two are fighting for his head. The barbecue crackles and bubbles in
   his head and the amethyst droplets crystallize into broken glass, and then
   tin, a tin piano. The earphones seem to get bigger and bigger, huge padded
   shells about to enclose his whole head, his face, his nose-amok sound
   overpowering him, as if it is all going to end right here inside this
   padded globe-panic-he leaps up from the seat, bolts a few feet with the
   earphones still clamped on his skull, then rips them off and jumps out of
   the bus-Pranksters everywhere in the afternoon sun, in red and white
   striped shirts. Babbs has the power and is directing the movie and is
   trying to shoot something-Acid Piper. Sandy looks about. Nobody he can
   tell it to, that he has taken acid by himself and it is turning into a
   bummer, he can't bring this out front... He runs into the house, the walls
   keep jumping up so goddamn close and all the angles are under extreme
   stress, as if they could break. Jane Burton is sitting alone in the house,
   feeling bilious. Jane is the only person he can tell.

   "Jane," he says, "I took some acid ... and it's really weird ..." But it
   is such an effort to talk ...

   The heat waves are solidifying in the air like the waves in a child's
   marble and the perspectives are all berserk, walls rushing up then sinking
   way back like a Titian banquet hall. And the heat-Sandy has to do
   something to pull himself together, so he takes a shower. He undresses and
   gets in the shower and ... flute music, Babbs! flute music comes spraying
   out of the nozzle and the heat is inside of him, it is like he can look
   down and see it burning there and he looks down, two bare legs, a torso
   rising up at him and like he is just noticing them for the first time.
   They exist apart from, like another human being's, such odd turns and
   angles they take amid the flute streams, swells and bony processes, like
   he has never seen any of this before, this flesh, this stranger. He groks
   over that-only it isn't a stranger, it is his . . . mother . .. and
   suddenly he is back in this body, only it is his mother's body-and then
   his father's-he has become his mother and his father. No difference
   between I and Thou inside this shower of flutes on the Florida littoral.
   He wrenches the water off, and it stops the flute. He is himself
   again-hide from the panic-no, gotcha-and he pulls on his clothes and goes
   back out in the living room. Jane is still sitting there. Talk, christ, to
   somebody-Jane!-but the room goes into the zooms, wild lurches of
   perspective, a whole side of the room zooming right up in front of his
   face, then zooming back to where it was-Jane!-Jane in front of his face, a
   foot away, then way back over there on the sofa, then zooming up again,
   all of it rocketing back and forth in the hulking heat-"Sandy!"-somebody
   is in the house looking for him, Hagen? who is it?-seems Babbs wants him
   in the movie. Red-and-white striped Pranksters burning in the sun. Seems
   Babbs has an idea for a section of the movie. In this scene Babbs is the
   Pied Piper, tootling on a flute, and all the red-and-white striped
   children are running after him in colorful dances. They hand Sandy a
   Prankster shirt, which he doesn't want. It is miles too big. It hangs on
   him in this sick loose way like he is desiccating in the sun. Into the
   sun-the shirt starts flashing under his face in the sun in explosive beams
   of sunball red and sunball silver-white as if he is moving through an aura
   of violent beams. Babbs gives him his cue and he starts a crazy dance out
   by a clothesline while the camera whirrs away. He can feel the crazy look
   come over his face and feel his eyeballs turning up and white with just
   vague flashes of red and silver-white exploding in under his eyelids...
   and the freaking heat, dancing like a crazy in the sun, and he goes
   reeling off to one side.

   It becomes very important that nobody know he has taken Unauthorized Acid.
   He can trust Jane ... This is not very out front, but he must remain very
   cool. Chuck Kesey is marching around the yard blowing a tuba, going boop
   boop a boop boop very deep and loud, then he comes by Sandy and looks at
   him and smiles over the mouthpiece and goes bup bup a bup bup, very tender
   and soft and-intersubjectivity!-he knows and understands-and that is nice
   because Chuck is one of the nicest people in the world and Sandy can trust
   him. If only he can remain cool...

   There is a half pound of grass in a tin can by the bus and Sandy gets down
   on all fours to help and starts digging his playing in the sun, and he
   somehow kicks over the can and the grass spills all over this silty brown
   dirt. Everybody is upset and Hagen gets down to try to separate the grass
   from the dirt, and Sandy gets down on all fours to help and starts digging
   his fingers into the dirt to try to dig out the grass, only as he starts
   digging, the dirt gets browner and browner as he digs, and he starts
   grooving over the brownness of it, so brown, so deep, so rich, until he is
   digging way past the grass, on down into the ground, and Hagen says,

   "Hey! What the hell's the matter with you?"

   And Sandy knows he should just come out with it and say, I'm stoned man,
   and this brown is a groove, and then it would be all out front and over
   with. But he can't bring himself to do it, he can't bring himself all the
   way out front. Instead, it gets worse.

   Kesey comes over with a football and a spray can of Day-Glo. He wants
   Sandy to spray it Day-Glo, and then he and Babbs and some others are going
   to take it out near the water at dusk and pass the Day-Glo ball around,
   and Sandy starts spraying it, only it's all one thing, the ball and
   Kesey's arm, and he is spraying Kesey's arm in the most dedicated, cool
   way, and Kesey says:

   "Hey! What the hell's the matter with you-"

   And as soon as he says it, he knows, which is suddenly very bad.

   "I'm ... stoned," says Sandy. "I took some acid, and I . .. took too much
   and it's going very bad."

   "We wanted to save that acid for the trip back," Kesey says. "We wanted to
   have some for the Rockies."

   "I didn't take that much"-he's trying to explain it, but now a Beatles
   record is playing over the loudspeaker of the bus and it's raining into
   his head like needles-"but it's bad."

   Kesey looks exasperated, but he tries some condolence. "Look-just stay
   with it. Listen to the music-"

   "Listen to the music!" Sandy yells. "Christ! Try and stop me!"

   Kesey says very softly: "I know how you feel, Sandy. I've been there
   myself. But you just have to stay with it"-which makes Sandy feel good:
   he's with me. But then Kesey says, "But if you think I'm going to be your
   guide for this trip, you're sadly mistaken." And he walks off.

   Sandy starts feeling very paranoid. He walks off, away from the house, and
   comes upon some sort of greeny glade in the woods. Babbs and Gretchen
   Fetchin are lying on the ground in the shade, just lazing on it, but
   Babb's legs shift and his arms move and Gretch's legs shift, and Sandy
   sees ... Babbs and Gretch in a pond, swimming languidly. He knows they are
   on ground, and yet they are in the water-and he says,

   "How is it?"

   "Wet!" says Babbs.

   -and-marvelous-it is very nice-as if Babbs knows exactly what is in his
   mind-synch-and is going to swing with it. We are all one brain out here
   and we are all on the bus, after all. And suddenly there in the Florida
   glade it is like the best of the whole Prankster thing all over again.

   He came back to the house at dark, into the yard, and there were a million
   stars in the sky, like tiny neon bulbs, and you could see them between the
   leaves of the trees, and the trees seemed to be covered with a million
   tiny neon bulbs, and the bus, it broke up into a sculpture of neon bulbs,
   millions of them massed together to make a bus, like a whole nighttime of
   neon dust, with every particle a neon bulb, and they all vibrated like a
   huge friendly neon cicada universe.

   He goes down to the water where the Pranksters all are, a little inlet,
   and it is dark and placid and he gets in and wades out until the water
   laps almost even with his mouth, which makes it very secure and warm and
   calm and nice and he looks at the stars and then at a bridge in the
   distance. All he can see of the bridge is the lights on it, swooping
   strands of lights, rising, rising, rising-and just then Chuck Kesey comes
   gliding toward him through the water, smiling, like a great friendly fish.
   Chuck knows and it is very nice-and the lights of the bridge keep rising,
   rising, until they merge with the stars, until there is a bridge leading
   right up into heaven.

                                      VIII

                            Tootling the Multitudes

   IN GEORGIA THEY PULLED OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE HIGH-way at a rest area, by
   a lake. Old Brother John put on a Robin Hood hat and sang a lot of salty
   songs and got the MDT Award, Most Disgusting Trip. Babbs nailed a baby
   doll up on a post and painted it Day-Glo and nailed a lot of nails through
   it and burnt it, and he got an MDT Award, too. Then something happened
   that made Sandy very happy. He got the idea of spraying his hand in
   Day-Glo designs and getting in the water and then rushing up out of the
   water with his hand stretched out toward Hagen's movie camera so the film
   would show an enormous Day-Glo hand rushing up in frantic foreshortening.
   Everybody grooved on that and started doing it, and Sandy felt like he now
   shared part of the power. Everybody started painting one hand Day-Glo and
   opening it and sticking one vast vibrating Day-Glo palm out at the
   straight world floating by comatose .. . Kesey held another briefing, and
   without anybody having to say anything, they all began to feel that the
   trip was becoming a ... mission, of some sort. Kesey said he wanted them
   all to do their thing and be Pranksters, but he wanted them to be deadly
   competent, too. Like with the red rubber balls they were always throwing
   around when they got out of the bus. The idea of the red rubber balls was
   that every Prankster should always be ready to catch the ball, even if he
   wasn't looking when it came at him. They should always be that alert,
   always that alive to the moment, always that deep in the whole group
   thing, and be deadly competent.

   Well, one Prankster who was proving out deadly competent was Cassady. They
   highballed on up the Eastern seaboard to New York, and highballing was
   about it. Cassady had never been in better form. By this time everybody
   who had any reservations about Cassady had forgotten it. Cassady had been
   a rock on this trip, the totally dependable person. When everybody else
   was stroked out with fatigue or the various pressures, Cassady could still
   be counted on to move. It was as if he never slept and didn't need to. For
   all his wild driving he always made it through the last clear oiled gap in
   the maze, like he knew it would be there all the time, which it always
   was. When the bus broke down, Cassady dove into the ancient innards and
   fixed it. He changed tires, lugging and heaving and jolting and bolting,
   with his fantastic muscles popping out striation by striation and his
   basilic veins gorged with blood and speed.

   Coming up over the Blue Ridge Mountains everybody was stoned on acid,
   Cassady included, and it was at that moment that he decided to make it all
   the way down the steepest, awfulest windingest mountain highway in the
   history of the world without using the brakes. The lurid bus started
   barreling down the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. Kesey was up on top
   of the bus to take it all in. He was up there and he could feel the motion
   of the thing careening around the curves and the road rippling and
   writhing out in front of him like someone rippling a bull-whip. He felt
   totally synched with Cassady, however. It was as if, if he were panicked,
   Cassady would be panicked, panic would rush through the bus like an
   energy. And yet he never felt panic. It was an abstract thought. He had
   total faith in Cassady, but it was more than faith. It was as if Cassady,
   at the wheel, was in a state of satori, as totally into this very moment,
   Now, as a being can get, and for that moment they all shared it.

   THEY REACHED NEW YORK IN THE MIDDLE OF JULY, AND THEY were like horses in
   the home stretch. Everybody felt good. They tooled across 42nd Street and
   up Central Park West with the speakers blaring and even New York had to
   stop and stare. The Pranksters gave them the Day-Glo glad hands, Kesey and
   Babbs got up on top of the bus with their red-and-white striped shirts on
   and tootled the people. This tootling had gotten to be a thing where you
   got on top of the bus and played people like they were music, the poor
   comatose world outside. If a guy looked at you fat and pissed off, you
   played on the flute in dying elephant tones. If a woman looked up nervous
   and twittering, you played nervous and twittering. It was saying it right
   to their faces, out front, and they never knew what to do. And New
   York-what a dirge New York was. The town was full of solemn, spent,
   irritable people shit-kicking their way down the sidewalks. A shit kicker
   is a guy with a frown on and his eyes on the ground, sloughing forward
   with his shoes scuffing the pavement like he's kicking horseshit out of
   the way saying oh that this should happen to me. The shit kickers gave
   them many resentful looks, which was the Pranksters' gift to the shit
   kickers. They could look up at the bus and say those are the bastids who
   are causing it, all the shit. They pulled into the big driveway out front
   of the Tavern on the Green, a big restaurant in Central Park, and tootled
   the people there. One way or another they were drawing the whole freaking
   town into their movie, and Hagen got it all on film.

   One of the old Perry Lane crowd, Chloe Scott, had arranged to get them an
   apartment of some friends of hers who were away for the summer, up on
   Madison Avenue at 90th Street. They parked the bus out front and had a
   time for themselves. Cassady looked up all his old pals from the On the
   Road days. Two of them were Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg.

   They gave a party up at the apartment at Madison and 90th and Kerouac and
   Ginsberg were there. A guy also showed up saying, Hi, I'm Terry Southern
   and this is my wife Carol. He was a pretty funny guy and talked a blue
   streak most amiably. It was a week before they found out he wasn't Terry
   Southern and didn't even look like him. It was just some guy's little
   freaky prank and they were glad they had gone ahead and wailed with it.
   Kesey and Kerouac didn't say much to each other. Here was Kerouac and here
   was Kesey and here was Cassady in between them, once the mercury for
   Kerouac and the whole Beat Generation and now the mercury for Kesey and
   the whole-what?-something wilder and weirder out on the road. It was like
   hail and farewell. Kerouac was the old star. Kesey was the wild new comet
   from the West heading christ knew where.

   Sometimes a Great Notion came out and the reviews ran from the very best
   to the very worst. In the daily New York Herald Tribune, Maurice Dolbier
   said: "In the fiction wilderness, this is a towering redwood." Granville
   Hicks said: "In his first novel, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Ken
   Kesey demonstrated that he was a forceful, inventive and ambitious writer.
   All of these qualities are exhibited, in even higher degree, in Sometimes
   a Great Notion. Here he has told a fascinating story in a fascinating
   way." John Barkham of the Saturday Review said: "A novelist of unusual
   talent and imagination ... a huge, turbulent tale ..." Time said it was a
   big novel-but that it was overwritten and had failed. Some of the critics
   seemed put out with the back-woodsy, arch, yep-bub-golly setting of the
   novel and the unusual theme of the heroic strikebreaker and the craven
   union men. Leslie Fiedler wrote an ambivalent review in the Herald
   Tribune's Book Week, but in any case it was a long, front-page review by a
   major critic. Newsweek  said the book "rejects the obligations of art and
   therefore ends up as a windy, detailed mock-epic barrel-chested
   counterfeit of life." Orville Prescott in The New York Times called it "A
   Tiresome Literary Disaster" and said: "His monstrous book is the most
   insufferably pretentious and the most totally tiresome novel I have had to
   read in many years." He referred to Kesey as "a beatnik type" who had been
   the model for Dean Moriarty in Kerouac's On the Road, confusing Kesey with
   Cassady. The Pranksters got a good laugh over that. The old guy was mixed
   up and ... maybe put out by the whole thing of the bus and the big assault
   upon New York: stop the Huns...

   But the hell with it. Kesey was already talking about how writing was an
   old-fashioned and artificial form and pointing out, for all who cared to
   look . . . the bus. The local press, including some of the hipper, smaller
   sheets, gave it a go, but nobody really comprehended what was going on,
   except that it was a party. It was a party, all right. But in July of 1964
   not even the hip world in New York was quite ready for the phenomenon of a
   bunch of people roaring across the continental U.S.A. in a bus covered
   with swirling Day-Glo mandalas aiming movie cameras and microphones at
   every freaking thing in this whole freaking country while Neal Cassady
   wheeled the bus around the high curves like Super Hud and the U.S. nation
   streamed across the windshield like one of those goddamned Cinemascope
   landscape cameras that winds up your optic nerves like the rubber band in
   a toy airplane and let us now be popping more speed and acid and smoking
   grass as if it were all just coming out of Cosmo the Prankster god's own
   local-option gumball machines-

   Cosmo!

   Furthur.

                                 The Crypt Trip

   IF THERE WAS ANYBODY IN THE WORLD WHO WAS GOING TO comprehend what the
   Pranksters were doing, it was going to be Timothy Leary and his group, the
   League for Spiritual Discovery, up in Millbrook, New York. Leary and his
   group had been hounded out of Harvard, out of Mexico, out of here, out of
   there, and had finally found a home in a big Victorian mansion in
   Millbrook, on private land, an estate belonging to a wealthy New York
   family, the Hitchcocks. So the bus headed for Millbrook.

   They headed off expecting the most glorious reception ever. It is probably
   hard at this late date to understand how glorious they thought it was
   going to be. The Pranksters thought of themselves and Leary's group as two
   extraordinary arcane societies, and the only ones in the world, engaged in
   the most fantastic experiment in human consciousness ever devised. The
   thing was totally new. And now the two secret societies bearing this
   new-world energy surge were going to meet.

   The Pranksters entered the twisty deep green Gothic grounds of Millbrook
   with flags flying, American flags all over the bus, and the speakers
   blaring rock 'n' roll, on in over the twisty dirt road, through the
   tangled greeny thickets, past the ponds and glades, like a rolling
   yahooing circus. When they got in sight of the great gingerbread mansion
   itself, all towers and turrets and jigsaw shingles, Sandy Lehmann-Haupt
   started throwing green smoke bombs off the top of the bus, great booms and
   blooms of green smoke exploding off the sides of the bus like epiphytes as
   the lurid thing rolled and jounced around the curves. We are here ! We are
   here !

   The Pranksters expected the Learyites to come rolling out of the house
   like the survivors of the siege of Khartoum. Instead-a couple of figures
   there on the lawn dart back into the house. The Pranksters stop in front
   and there is just the big house sitting there sepulchral and Gothic-and
   them jumping off the bus still yahooing and going like hell. Finally a few
   souls materialize. Peggy Hitchcock and Richard Alpert and Susan Metzner,
   the wife of Dr. Ralph Metzner, another leading figure in the Leary group.
   Alpert looks the bus up and down and shakes his head and says, "Ke-n-n-n
   Ke-e-e-esey ..." as if to say I might have known that you would be the
   author of this collegiate prank. They are friendly, but it is a mite ...
   cool here, friends. Maynard Ferguson, the jazz trumpet player, and his
   wife, Flo, are there, and they groove over the bus, but the others . . .
   there is a general. . . vibration ... of: We have something rather deep
   and meditative going on here, and you California crazies are a sour note.

   Finally, Peggy Hitchcock invites some of them over to her house, a big
   modern house, known as The Bungalow, off from the gingerbread manse. Babbs
   is one of them. Babbs and the Pranksters are not ready for a lazy
   afternoon in the country, meditative or not. Inside The Bungalow, Babbs
   came upon a big framed photograph on the wall, looking like a Yale class
   picture from the year '03, a lot of young fellers seated, in tiers, in a
   clump and staring full-face at the camera.

   "There's Cassady!" says Babbs.

   "There's Hassler!"

   "There's Kesey!"

   "There's Sandy!"

   They found every single man on the bus in the picture, while the Learyites
   looked on, tolerantly, and Babbs got the idea of "The Pranksters'
   Ancestral Mansion."

   The Learyites were going to take them on a tour of the great gingerbread
   mansion, but it became Babbs's tour. He started leading it.

   "Now ladies and gentlemen," he said, "we are embarked upon the first
   annual tour of the Pranksters' Ancestral Mansion. Now over here you may
   regard"-he points to a big lugubrious oil portrait, or something of the
   sort, up on the wall-"one of the Pranksters' great forefathers, sire and
   scion of the fabulous line, the fabulous lion, Sir Edward the Freak. Sir
   Edward the Freak, a joke in his own time. I've heard if he got aroused, he
   would freak a whole block of city, Sir Edward the Freak-"

   -and so on, while the Learyites tagged along, looking more and more dour,
   as if they sensed disaster, Babbs looking more and more animated, rapping
   off everything, the ancestral staircase, the ancestral paneling, the
   ancestral fireplace, his rheostat eyes turning up to 300 watts-

   -then down to one of the four "meditation centers," little sanctums where
   the Learyites retreated for the serious business of meditation upon inner
   things-

   "-and now, for this part of our tour, the Crypt Trip-" And the Pranksters
   started rapping off the Crypt Trip, while Babbs entered into a parody
   rendition of The Tibetan Book of the Dead. This was one of the Learyites'
   most revered texts. "This is where we take our followers to hang them up
   when they're high," says Babbs, "the Crypt Trip." The clear message was
   Fuck you, Mill-brook, for your freaking frostiness.

   Other Pranksters were out playing under a little waterfall in the woods.
   Zonker's girl friend Kathy, whom he had picked up in New York, sat under
   the waterfall and the water pasted her bikini, or her bra and panties, or
   whatever it was she had on, pasted it most nicely to her body and Hagen
   filmed it. She became Sensuous X in the great movie.

   Where was Leary? Everyone was waiting for the great meeting of Leary and
   Kesey.

   Well, word came down that Leary was upstairs in the mansion engaged in a
   very serious experiment, a three-day trip, and could not be disturbed.

   Kesey wasn't angry, but he was very disappointed, even hurt. It was
   unbelievable-this was Millbrook, one big piece of uptight constipation,
   after all this.

   The Pranksters made a few more stabs at getting things going around
   Millbrook, but it seemed like everybody in the place was retreating to
   some corner or other. Finally they pulled out. Before they left, Kesey
   asked Alpert if he could get them some more acid. He said he couldn't, but
   he could give them some morning-glory seeds. Morning-glory seeds. The idea
   of morning-glory seeds sloshing around in your belly like a ptomaine bean
   bag while the bus bounced and shook and swayed and leaned out on the
   curves was more than a body could bear. So thanks anyway, and sayonara,
   you all, League for Spiritual Discovery.

                                   Dream Wars

   ON THE TRIP BACK WEST THEY TOOK THE NORTHERN ROUTE, through Ohio, Indiana,
   Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, South Dakota-

   South Dakota! 191 miles in South Dakota ...

   -which made it all cooler, for a start... In fact, the trip back was a
   psychic Cadillac, a creamy groove machine, and they soon found themselves
   grooving in a group mind. Now they could leave behind all the mind-blown
   freaky binds and just keep going Furthur! on the bus. For example, Zonker
   meant to stay in New York but he went back with them. He couldn't break
   off from the group mind takeoff that had begun, the Unspoken Thing, the
   all-in-one ... He brought with him his gorgeous blond telepathic girl
   friend Kathy, who felt at once the careening, crazydreaming, creamy
   bobbing rhythm of the bus and became at once recklessly and infectiously
   and insenescibly and ultra-infra-sexily one of them: most sinuous
   Prankstress in their ranks. The Pranksters named her Sensuous X, glowing
   girl friend resolutely going ... Furthur ... Kesey laid eyes on the
   Sensuous horizon-loved it! On the bus. Next, she became Zonker's sensuous
   ex-lost her! On the bus. At first Zonker's mad, feels he's been
   had-affront! But then thanks to his feeling for the Prankster experiment,
   he sees nothing to resent. There can be no hard feelings when one is
   dealing totally out front on the bus.

   There was very little LSD left, so they were taking mostly speed and
   grass, soaring through the Northlands, on Speed. For Sandy-at Millbrook a
   Main Guru had taken Sandy and Jane aside and confided: It would be good if
   you took the Millbrook trip alone ... meaning, probably, without your
   obstreperous companions, i.e., off the bus, and Sandy had... Dis-Mounted
   again and returned to Millbrook, with Jane, and the Main Guru turned him
   on to DMT, a 30-minute trip like LSD but with a fierce roan-mad
   intensity-fragments! Sandy had a mad sense of the world torn apart into
   stained-glass shards behind his eyelids. No matter what he did, eyes open,
   eyes shut, the world erupted into electric splinters and the Main Guru
   said, "I wish to enter your metaphysical soul." But to Sandy-paranoia!-he
   seemed like a randy-painted lulu bent on his rectococcygeal shoals, a
   randy boy-enjoyer, while the world exploded and there was no antidote for
   this rocketing, rocketing, rocketing, rocketing... They returned to New
   York and Jane disembarked from the bus, stayed behind, but Sandy felt
   impelled to ride it out on the bus with the rest of the Pranksters,
   heading west, rocketing, rocketing, rocketing, rocketing Furthur ... And
   now in the Midwest it ' was as if the DMT trip at Millbrook had been the
   last stage of a rocket and his whole psyche was now committed to speed and
   motion, and it was necessary to keep soaring through the Northlands.
   Certain vibrations of the bus would trip his brain somehow and suddenly
   bring back the sensation of the rocketing DMT trip and it would be
   necessary to speed up and keep moving. The sweet wheatfields and dairy
   lands of America would be sailing by beauty rural green and curving, and
   Sandy is watching the serene beauty of it... and then he happens to look
   into the big rear-view mirror outside the bus and-the fields are-in flames
   :::::::: curve and curdle straight up in hideous orange flames ::::: So he
   whips his head around and looks way back as far as he can see and over
   over to the horizon and it is nothing but flat and sweet and green again,
   sailing by serene. Then he looks back into the mirror-and the flames shoot
   up again, soaring, corn and lespedeza turning brown like burning color
   film when the projector is too hot and bursting into flames, corn, wheat,
   lespedeza turning into brown scouring rush, death camass, bloodwort, wild
   iris, blue flag, grease wood, poison sucklyea, monkshood mandrake,
   moonseed, fitweed, locoweed, tumble mustard, spurge nettle, coyote
   tobacco, crab's eye bursting into flames-a sea of flames-a mirror with a
   sea of flames, Narcissus, Moon, twins, thesis and anti-thesis, infirmity
   of life, as if he is forced to endure at any moment the visual revelation
   of a pa-leopsychic mystery-and Sandy looks away and forces himself not to
   look toward the rearview mirror and once again just sun and the green
   belly of America sailing by . ..

   ... serene. Certain things worked smoothly on every level. They knew how
   to run the bus better, for one thing, even though Cassady had had to go
   back ahead of time by car with Hassler, who had to report back to Fort
   Ord. The Pranksters took turns driving. Getting food, copping urinations,
   shooting the movie, making tapes-they managed it all like a team. Once a
   few minor personal hassles were worked out-out front-and the bus crossed
   the Mississippi, and they were way out West-then it all merged into the
   Group Mind and became very psychic . . .

   Intersubjectivity!

   .. . Sandy himself wheeling the bus through dour Roosian South Dakota with
   cold shadows sweeping over the green and golden grasslands. No sea of
   flames now, just a green and gold sea, serene, coming from out of the
   stream of the Northlands themselves-and sleep means nothing, because there
   is no time, only Now, a perfect experience in the perfect momentum set
   perfectly by his foot on the accelerator-for 191 miles he drove, by the
   speedometer. Then he goes to the back of the bus and there up on the
   ceiling is a map of the U.S. pasted up there, and-see!-there is a red line
   on the map, leaping out on, and it is exactly those 191 miles he drove,
   glowing on the ceiling of the bus. He looks around, starts asking, very
   excited-and Sensuous X said she made the line-

   "Why!"

   Sensuous doesn't know. No why to it. She just had the crayon and that was
   where the line went-

   -but no need to explain. Telepathic Kathy ! Just one line, one current,
   running through the entire bus. Group Mind, and Cosmic Control, on the bus
   ...

   Then the bus heads up into Canada, to Calgary, to catch the Calgary
   Stampede. The unquenchable Hagen of the Screw Shack prowls the Stampede
   for ginch ahoof and comes back to the bus with nice little girl with lips
   as raunchy as a swig of grape soda, tender in age but ne'mind, ready to
   go, and she is on the bus, christened Anonymous, down to her bra and
   panties, which she prefers. The call goes out to the Canadian Royal
   Mounties for the runaway, or stowaway, the little girl from the Stampede,
   and they stop the bus in the road check-

   -Why, come right on in, officers, take a look around-

   -while Hagen grinds the camera at them-

   -while the Head Mountie rereads the long description, five feet two, dark
   hair, etc., and checks out Sensuous X and Gretch and Anonymous in the
   window-

   -Anonymous reads the description over the Mountie's shoulder, perched up
   at the window, and laughs merrily at such a funny-sounding girl-she by now
   having her face all painted up in Prankster designs and half her
   grape-soda body as well so that she doesn't look too much like the pretty
   helpless waif Grandma described to the Mounties, and the Mounties wave
   them by and peer on down the road for the next.

   Next down to Boise, Idaho, and everywhere Kesey and Babbs up top the bus
   with flutes, mercilessly tootling the people of America as they crowd
   around the bus and getting pretty good at it even. Winces here and there
   as some little cringing shell in the population pinioned in his crispy
   black shiny shoes knows, no mistake, that it is him they have singled
   out-they are playing my song, the desperate sound track from my movie-and
   Kesey and Babbs score again and again, like the legendary Zen archers, for
   they no longer play their music at people but inside them. They play
   inside them, oh merciless flow. And many things are clear in the flow.
   They are above the multitudes, looking down from the Furthur heights of
   the bus, and the billion eyes of America glisten at them like electric
   kernels, and yet the Pranksters are grooving with this whole wide-screen
   America and going with its flow with American flags flying from the bus
   and taking energy, as in solar heat, from its horsepower and its neon and
   there is no limit to the American trip. Bango!-that's it!-the trouble with
   Leary and his group is that they have turned back. But of course! They
   have turned back into that old ancient New York intellectual thing, ducked
   back into the romantic past, copped out of the American trip. New York
   intellectuals have always looked for . .. another country, a fatherland of
   the mind, where it is all better and more philosophic and purer,
   gadget-free, and simpler and pedigreed: France or England, usually-oh, the
   art of living, in France, boys. The Learyites have done the same thing,
   only with them it's-India-the East-with all the ancient flap-doodle of
   Gautama Buddha or the Rig-Veda blowing in like mildew, and Leary calls for
   blue grass growing in the streets of New York, and he decrees that
   everyone should have such a dwelling place of such pristine antique decor,
   with everyone hunkered down amid straw rugs and Paisley wall hangings,
   that the Gautama Buddha himself from 485 b.c. could walk in and feel at
   home instantly. Above all, keep quiet, for God's sake, hold it down,
   whisper, moan, mumble, meditate, and for chris-sake, no gadgets-no tapes,
   video tapes, TV, movies, Hagstrom electric basses, variable lags, American
   flags, no neon, Buick Electras, mad moonstone-faced Servicenters, and no
   manic buses, f r chrissake, soaring, doubledyclutch doubledyclutch, to the
   Westernmost edge-

   And in Boise they cut through a funeral or wedding or something, so many
   dressed-up people in the sun gawking at Pranksters gathered at a fountain
   and all cutting up in the sunspots, and a kid-they have tootled his song,
   and he likes it, and he runs for the bus and they all pile on and pull
   out, just ahead of him, and he keeps running for the bus, and Kesey keeps
   slowing down and then pulling out just out of his reach, six or eight
   blocks this way, and then they speed up for good, and they can still see
   him floating away in the background, his legs still running, like a
   preview-

   -allegory of life!-

   -of the multitudes who very shortly will want to get on the bus . . .
   themselves . . .

   Back at Kesey's in La Honda,

   Deep into the rusky-dusky neon dusty,

   More synched in than

   They had ever been,

   Deep into the Unspoken Thing,

   The Pranksters now aligned

   Along a sheerly dividing line:

   Before the bus and

   After the bus,

   On the bus or

   Off the bus,

   A sheerly Diluvial divide:

   Did you take the Epoch Ride?

   One-way ticket into the nirvana thickets

   Of the ex redwood cathedra Unspoken Thing.

   Most peaceful synching in,

   Serene bacchanal

   For all...

   ... except Sandy. For Sandy, the bus had stopped but he hadn't. It was as
   if the bus had hit a wall and he had shot out the window and was living in
   the suspended interminable moment before he hit-what? He didn't know. All
   he knew was that there would be a crash unless the momentum of the
   Pranksters suddenly resumed and caught up with him the way the Flash, in
   the Pranksters' ubiquitous comic books, caught speeding bullets by
   streaking at precisely their speed and reaching out and picking them up
   like eggs...

   Sandy went about wide-eyed and nervous, an endless ratchet of activity
   that no one quite comprehended at first. The bus was parked out in front
   of the log house and Kesey would be inside the bus doing something and
   Sandy, outside the door, would suddenly begin arguing with him over some
   esoteric point of the sound system. Kesey was keeping the tapes on a hick
   level, he was saying. Kesey was, like, rustling cellophane in front of a
   microphone for "fire," and so forth and so on. So many complaints! Until
   Kesey puts his arms up on the walls of the bus in the Christ on the Cross
   gesture-which is precisely what one of Sandy's brothers used to do when he
   started complaining-and this drives Sandy into a rage and he yells Fuck
   you! and gives Kesey the finger. Kesey streaks out of the door of the bus
   and pins Sandy up against the side of the bus-and it is all over as fast
   as that. Sandy is overwhelmed. He has never seen Kesey use his tremendous
   strength against anyone before, and it is overwhelming, the idea of it
   even. But it is all over in no time. Kesey is suddenly calm again and asks
   Sandy to come with him to the backhouse, the shack by the creek. He wants
   to talk to him.

   So they go out there and Kesey talks to Sandy about Sandy's attitude.
   Sandy is still Dis-mount, still getting off the bus continually, and why?
   You don't understand, says Sandy. You don't understand my dis-mounting.
   It's like climbing a mountain. Would you rather climb the mountain or have
   a helicopter deposit you on the top? The continual climb, the continual
   remounting, makes it a richer experience, and so on. Kesey nods in a
   somewhat abstracted way and says O.K., Sandy ...

   But Sandy feels paranoid . .. what do they really think of him? What are
   they planning? What insidious prank? He can't get it out of his mind that
   they are building up to some prank of enormous proportions, at his
   expense. A Monstrous Prank ... He can't sleep, his brain keeps going at
   the furious speed of the bus on the road, like an eternal trip on speed.

   Then Kesey devised a game called "Power." He took a dart-board and covered
   it with Masonite and put a spinner in the middle and marked off spoke
   lines forming one section for each Prankster. Each person's Prankster name
   was written in his section, Intrepid Traveler for Babbs, Mai Function for
   Hagen, Speed Limit for Cassady, Hassler for Ron Bevirt, Gretchen Fetchin
   for Paula-in truth, her old name and persona were gone entirely and she
   was now a new person known as Gretchen Fetchin or Gretch. Sandy looked and
   in his section it said: "dis-MOUNT," with the heavy accent on Mount, even
   as he had explained it to Kesey in the backhouse. He was overwhelmed with
   relief and gratitude. Kesey knew! Kesey understood! He was back in the
   bus.

   Everybody was to write out some "tasks" on slips of paper and they would
   all be put in a big pile. Then the spinner was spun, and if it landed on
   you, you reached into the pile and pulled out a "task," which you then had
   to do, and the others gave you points according to how well you had done
   the task, on a scale of one to five points, five being the best. A lot of
   the tasks were very pranked-up, like "put on an article of somebody else's
   clothing." There was a scoreboard and everybody moved his counter up the
   scoreboard as he picked up points. Everybody made his own counter. Sandy
   was making his out of Sculpt Metal. He stretched it to a long spidery
   length, then suddenly compressed it into an ugly wad, because that was the
   way he was beginning to feel. So Page picked it up and made a nice little
   form out of it, like a bridge, and everybody said that's the way it should
   be done-and Sandy feels the paranoia coming back ...

   The prize for winning was: Power. Thirty minutes of absolute power in
   which your word was law and everyone had to do whatever you wanted. Very
   allegorical, this game. By and by Babbs won a game and he ordered
   everybody to bring everything they possessed into the living room.
   Everybody went forth and hauled in all their stuff, out to the bedrooms,
   tents, Kampers, sleeping bags, the bus, and brought in a ragamuffin
   mountain of clothes, shoes, boots, toys, paint pots, toothbrushes, books,
   boxes, capsules, stashes, letters, litter, junk. It was all piled up in
   the center of the room, a marvelous Rat mountain of junk. "Now," said
   Babbs, "we redistribute the wealth." And he would hold up some piece of it
   and say, "Who wants one 1964 Gretchen Fetchin toothbrush?" and somebody
   would hold up his hand and it would go to him and somebody else would
   catalogue it all solemnly on a legal pad.

   Then the pointer hits Sandy and he picks up a task, a slip of paper. It is
   in Gretch's handwriting, and it says: "Go out and build a fire." He reads
   it out loud and just keeps staring at it. Then they all stare at him,
   waiting for him to get up and go out and build a fire, and he feels them
   staring and then he knows-it is a very clever plot to get him out of the
   house, get him outside in the dark, and then pull the Monstrous Prank-

   And he starts blurting it all out. / can't do it. Can't you see how it is?
   It's getting awful-/ can't sleep and everything is like this:

   He lays the fingers of one hand over the fingers of the other, forming a
   trellis pattern, and peers through the spaces in between to show how
   everything keeps breaking up, fragmenting, his whole field of vision, ever
   since the DMT trip at Millbrook, and the sea of flames and the paranoia,
   the everlasting paranoia, he blurts it all out, everything that is hanging
   him up and rocketing him toward-what?

   And suddenly it is very quiet in the log house. Every Prankster eye is
   upon him, absorbed, giving him total... Attention, He has come all the way
   out front. The furious motion stops, and he suddenly feels :::: peace.

   "How many points do we give him?" says Kesey.

   And around the circle everyone says "Five!" "Five!" "Five!" "Five!"
   "Five!"-

   "Three," says Gretch, who had written the task in the first place-and
   Sandy-a small microgram of paranoia creeps back in like a mite...

   THE PRANKSTERS NOW REALIZED THAT SANDY WAS IN A BAD way. Kesey had a
   saying, "Feed the hungry bee." So the Pranksters set about showering . . .
   Attention on Sandy, to try to give him a feeling of being at the cool
   center of the whole thing. But he kept misinterpreting their gestures. Why
   are they staring? His insomnia became more and more severe. One night he
   walked down the road to the housing development, Redwood Terrace, to try
   to borrow some Sominex. He was just going to walk up to a door in the
   middle of the night and knock and ask for some Sominex. Somehow he had the
   old New York apartment-house idea that you walk down the hall and borrow a
   cup of sugar, even if you don't know the people. So he starts knocking on
   doors and asking for Sominex. Of course, they all either panic and shut
   the door or tell him to fuck off. The people of Redwood Terrace were a
   little paranoid themselves by this time about the crazies down the road at
   Kesey's.

   By day it was no better. As his insomnia got worse, he started having more
   fragmented vision and finally ... he looks at the wild-painted bus and the
   lurid chaos of the swirls changes into ... the tunnel ! A tunnel they had
   gone through, a long tunnel, in which he had been possessed by intense

   SALVATION? KESEY ANNOUNCES THEY ARE GETTING BACK ON the bus-moving
   again-and going up to Esalen Institute up in Big Sur, four hours drive to
   the south. Esalen was an "experiment in living," as they say, a sort of
   Roughin-it resort perched on a cliff about 1,000 feet above the Pacific. A
   very dramatic piece of Nature, in the nineteenth-century seascape fashion.
   Waves crashing way down below and sparkling air way up here and a view of
   half the world, mountains, ocean, sky, the whole show, in a word, for
   which Big Sur is famous. There was a lodge and a swimming pool and a
   stretch of greensward out to the edge of the cliff and some hot sulphur
   springs about 100 yards away, also perched on the side of a cliff, in
   which one could bathe and gaze out over the eternal ocean. Behind the
   lodge were rows of tiny cabins and a few trailers. These were for the
   clientele. The clients-well, to put it simply, Esalen was a place where
   educated middle-class adults came in the summer to try to get out of The
   Rut and wiggle their fannies a bit.

   The main theoretician at Esalen was a Gestalt psychologist named Fritz
   Perls. Perls was a great goateed man in his seventies who went about in a
   jump suit made of blue terrycloth. He had the air of a very learned,
   dignified, and authoritative blue bear. Perls was the father of the Now
   Trip. His theory was that most people live fantasy lives. They live
   totally in the past or in terms of what they expect in the future, which
   amounts to fear, generally. Perls tried to teach his patients, pupils, and
   the clients at Esalen to live Now for a change, in the present, to become
   aware of their bodies and all the information their senses brought them,
   to shelve their fears and seize the moment. They went through "marathon
   encounters," in which a group stayed together for days and brought
   everything out front, no longer hiding behind custom, saying what they
   really felt-shouts, accusations, embraces, tears-a perfect delight, of
   course: "You want to know what I really think of you ..." One of the
   exercises at Esalen was the Now Trip exercise, in which you try to
   catalogue the information your senses are bringing you in the present
   moment. You make a rapid series of statements beginning with the word
   "Now": "Now I feel the wind cooling the perspiration on my forehead ...
   Now I hear a bus coming up the drive in low gear ... Now I hear a Beatles
   record playing over a loudspeaker ..."

   A bus? A Beatles record? The Pranksters are here, Now Trippers. Kesey had
   been invited to Esalen to conduct a seminar entitled "A Trip with Ken
   Kesey." Nobody had quite counted on the entire fully wired and wailing
   Prankster ensemble, however. The clientele at Esalen had come a long way
   in a few weeks and many were beginning to peek over the edge of The Rut.
   And what they saw ... it could be scary out there in Freedomland. The
   Pranksters were friendly, but they glowed in the dark. They pranked about
   like maniacs in the serene Hot Springs. Precious few signed up for a trip
   with Ken Kesey, even in seminar form. Sandy, meanwhile, was swinging
   wildly from feelings of paranoia to feelings of godly . . . Power. And the
   trip was always the bus. One moment it was covered with the Hieronymus
   Bosch scenes of his most private Hell. The next-he controls the bus. One
   night he discovers he can unpaint the bus just by staring at it. He has
   psychokinetic powers. His stare bears the power of life or death. The
   waves crash below the Esalen cliff-and he stares at the bus and...
   unpaints it. He strips one whole side down to its original sunny
   school-bus yellow. The whole Prankster overlay is gone. A trick of the
   mind? He looks away, out over the Pacific and at the stars-then swings
   back suddenly toward the bus ::::: It is still unpainted :::: still virgin
   school-bus yellow.

   He has the power-but can it ward off the Monstrous Prank ? The Pranksters
   take the bus into Monterey to see a movie, The Night of the Iguana. He
   sits in the back of the bus, so he can watch them. If any of them tries
   anything, with one stare he can ... They go into the theater and he lags
   behind, then sits several rows behind them. To keep an eye out... There is
   a Tom and Jerry cartoon on the screen. The mouse, Jerry, tricks the cat,
   Tom, and the cat goes off a cliff and hits, flattened in an explosion of
   eyeballs, thousands of eyeballs. Everyone is laughing, but to Sandy it is
   sickening, incredibly brutal. He jumps up and runs out of the theater and
   wanders around Monterey for an hour and a half or so. Then he wanders back
   to the theater, and Hagen is standing outside.

   "Where the hell have you been? Kesey is looking all over for you.

   Sandy runs back into the theater. Kesey! He looks up on the screen-and the
   mouse, Jerry, tricks the cat, Tom, and the cat goes off a cliff and hits,
   flattened in an explosion of eyeballs, thousands of eyeballs... Sandy
   flees again. Kesey is now waiting outside. He coaxes Sandy on to the bus
   and they head back to Esalen.

   Back in Esalen, in his cabin, Sandy falls half asleep into ... dream wars!
   It is his Power vs. Kesey's, like Dr. Strange vs. Aggamon, and one of them
   will kill the other in the Dream War ... He exerts the utmost psychic
   energy ... opens his eyes and makes out a machine in the cabin-a heater?
   It looks like a heater but it is Kesey's death instrument, and in that
   moment the thermostat turns on the machine and a tiny red light comes
   on--Kesey's ray gun-has triumphed, filled him, and Sandy falls off the
   bed, dead, lying on the floor, and he leaves his body in astral projection
   and sails out over the Pacific, out from the Esalen cliff, out for 40 or
   50 miles, soaring, and the wind goes in gusts, huhhhh-hhnnnhh,
   huhhhhhhhhhnnnh, huhhhhhhhhhnnnh, and he is the wind, not even a compact
   spirit flying but a totally diffuse being, dissolved in the upper ethers,
   and he can see the whole moonlit ocean and Esalen way back there. Then he
   comes to, and he is on the floor of the cabin, breathing hard,
   huhhhhhhhhnnnh, huhhhh-hhhhhnnh, huhhhhhhhnnnh.

   "San-dy! San-dy! San-dy!"-daylight, and they're outside the cabin, calling
   him, the Pranksters... what Monstrous Prank?-

   In fact, Kesey had instructed the Pranksters to give Sandy total Attention
   to try to bring him around, to put him at the center of everything. Sandy
   comes out, sees them staring but takes it for glowers and aggression . ..
   Nevertheless-on to the bus, and they ride out along Big Sur in the
   sunlight. Kesey and the Pranksters have prepared a long Sandy document,
   twelve pages of text and drawings, very fanciful, like a psychic brief,
   bringing all of Sandy's fears out front and dispelling them in
   camaraderie-and it begins to work. Then as they roll along the cliff
   highway Kesey takes Sandy up on top of the bus for a Now Trip. They sit up
   there in the sun with the wind streaming by and Kesey is grooving off the
   designs on the hood of the bus: "Now I see the green snake form going into
   the red and the edge of it melts into ..." and so forth, and Sandy grooves
   off Kesey's Now Trip-Kesey!-Total Attention!-and it is like he is coming
   around at last, he feels on the bus again. And then he decides to take
   Kesey on a Now Trip, sailing along the cliff highway. "Now," says Sandy,
   "I see the ocean like a sheet of ice slanting in toward the shore . .. Now
   I see three suns..."-in truth! the vibration of the bus has thrown him
   into the DMT reaction. He gets a triple image from the vibration and
   shaking of the bus, but instead of refocusing on one sun, he keeps seeing
   three. Kesey looks up at the sky, and says, "Yeah, yeah," grooving with
   it, which makes Sandy feel very good . . .

   But then nighttime. "San-dy! San-dy!" They're trying to coax him out of
   the cabin again. For-what? Why, the Monstrous Prank, naturally, but... he
   has Power. Outside-they have candles, the Pranksters do, and they're
   beginning a candlelight march down a path in a ravine that cuts down
   through the cliff, all the way to the water's edge. For-what? Why, the
   Monst-But then Kesey's wife, Faye, comes up very silent and smiling and
   loving and gives him a candle and lights it, and Faye is like complete
   honesty and love, so he starts off, following them down the path, holding
   candles, while the surf booms up the ravine from below. Why do they want
   him to join this spooky procession? Why, for the most Monstrous Prank of
   all-to kill him at the water's edge, but he has the power-the candle dims
   in the wind, and then comes back up, burning full-but it is not the wind,
   it is Sandy-he can make it shrink and dim down just by staring at it,
   psychokinesis, then draw it back up, all with his mind, he can control the
   flame utterly, and it can control him, for they are one and the same, God,
   and he trudges down the ravine, becoming more and more powerful-but a girl
   named Lola has stopped ahead of him. He draws closer and she has a candle
   and is tilting it so that the wax drips on her fingers and she is grooving
   over the wax dripping over her fingers and grinning, and her hand, in wax,
   turns white and dead, a skeleton, and her grin, lit from beneath by the
   candle, turns waxy and zombie - the death starts here - and Sandy bolts,
   charging back up the ravine-

   -not knowing that the whole procession had been set up as a ceremony of
   love, a love trip, for him, to bring him around, a candlelit celebration
   of Sandy down by the water-

   -but he is long gone, running down the cliff highway now, toward Monterey,
   running until his lungs give out, then walking, then running up to the
   lights in the houses on the cliffs over the water, Big Sur summer places,
   and knocking on the door, screaming incoherently about jumping off the
   cliffs; until the police come. Gotcha! Which is a joke, because he can
   annihilate them any moment he chooses, with a psychokinetic ray-

   They put him in the back seat, streaking down Route 1 toward Monterey,
   wheeling around the curves, faster and faster-

   "Don't go so fast!" Sandy says.

   "What?"

   "Don't go so fast!"

   "Listen," the cop says. "I'll slow down if you stop staring at the back of
   my head."

   "Ahhhhhh."

   "Look out the window or something. Look at the scenery. Stop staring at
   the back of my head."

   So he takes his eyes out of the back of the cop's skull. Two fever hole
   depressions. Another moment-

   THE MONTEREY POLICE HELD HIM IN THE JAIL IN MONTEREY until his brother
   Chris could get there from New York. Chris ran into Kesey at the jail.
   We've got to get him out of here, said Kesey. What do you mean? We've got
   to get him back where he belongs, with the Pranksters. Chris took Sandy
   back to New York for treatment. It was a long time before Chris knew what
   in the hell Kesey had been talking about.

                               The Unspoken Thing

   HOW TO TELL IT! . . . THE CURRENT FANTASY ... I NEVER heard any of the
   Pranksters use the word religious to describe the mental atmosphere they
   shared after the bus trip and the strange days in Big Sur. In fact, they
   avoided putting it into words. And yet-

   They got on the bus and headed back to La Honda in the old Big Sur
   summertime, all frozen sunshine up here, and no one had to say it: they
   were all deep into some weird shit now, as they would just as soon call it
   by way of taking the curse . . . off the Unspoken Thing. Things were
   getting very psychic. It was like when Sandy drove 191 miles in South
   Dakota and then he had looked up at the map on the ceiling of the bus and
   precisely those 191 miles were marked in red ... Sandy : : : : : back in
   Brain Scan country the White Smocks would never in a million years
   comprehend where he had actually been ... which was where they all were
   now, also known as Edge City ... Back in Kesey's log house in La Honda,
   all sitting around in the evening in the main room, it's getting cool
   outside, and Page Browning: I think I'll close the window-and in that very
   moment another Prankster gets up and closes it for him and smi-i-i-i-les
   and says nothing . .. The Unspoken Thing-and these things keep happening
   over and over. They take a trip up into the High Sierras and Cassady pulls
   the bus off the main road and starts driving up a little mountain road-see
   where she goes. The road is so old and deserted the pavement is half
   broken up and they keep climbing and twisting up into nowhere, but the air
   is nice, and up at the top of the grade the bus begins bucking and gulping
   and won't pull any more. It just stops. It turns out they're out of gas,
   which is a nice situation because it's nightfall and they're stranded
   totally hell west of nowhere with not a gas station within thirty, maybe
   fifty miles. Nothing to do but stroke themselves out on the bus and go to
   sleep ... hmmmmmm ... scorpions with boots on red TWA Royal Ambassador
   slumber slippers on his big Stinger Howard Hughes in a sleeping bag on the
   floor in a marble penthouse in the desert

   Dawn

   All wake up to a considerable fetching and hauling and grinding up the
   grade below them and over the crest comes a

   Chevron

   gasoline tanker, a huge monster of a tanker. Which just stops like they
   all met somewhere before and gives them a tankful of gas and without a
   word heads on into the Sierras toward absolutely

   Nothing

   Babbs-Cosmic control, eh Hassler!

   And Kesey-Where does it go? I don't think man has ever been there. We're
   under cosmic control and have been for a long long time, and each time it
   builds, it's bigger, and it's stronger. And then you find out... about
   Cosmo, and you discover that he's running the show. ..

   The Unspoken Thing; Kesey's role and the whole direction the Pranksters
   were taking-all the Pranksters were conscious of it, but none of them put
   it into words, as I say. They made a point of not putting it into words.
   That in itself was one of the unspoken rules. If you label it this, then
   it can't be that... Kesey took great pains not to make his role explicit.
   He wasn't the authority, somebody else was: "Babbs says..." "Page says..."
   He wasn't the leader, he was the "non-navigator." He was also the
   non-teacher. "Do you realize that you're a teacher here?" Kesey says, "Too
   much, too much," and walks away... Kesey's explicit teachings were all
   cryptic, metaphorical; parables, aphorisms: "You're either on the bus or
   off the bus." "Feed the hungry bee," "Nothing lasts," "See with your ears
   and hear with your eyes," "Put your good where it will do the most," "What
   did the mirror say? It's done with people." To that extent it was like Zen
   Buddhism, with the inscrutable koans, in which the novice says, "What is
   the secret of Zen?" and Hui-neng the master says, "What did your face look
   like before your parents begat you?" To put it into so many words, to
   define it, was to limit it. If it's this, then it can't be that... Yet
   there it was! Everyone had his own thing he was working out, but it all
   fit into the group thing, which was-"the Unspoken Thing," said Page
   Browning, and that was as far as anyone wanted to go with words.

   For that matter, there was no theology to it, no philosophy, at least not
   in the sense of an ism. There was no goal of an improved moral order in
   the world or an improved social order, nothing about salvation and
   certainly nothing about immortality or the life hereafter. Hereafter! That
   was a laugh. If there was ever a group devoted totally to the here and now
   it was the Pranksters. I remember puzzling over this. There was something
   so... religious in the air, in the very atmosphere of the Prankster life,
   and yet one couldn't put one's finger on it. On the face of it there was
   just a group of people who had shared an unusual psychological state, the
   LSD experience-

   But exactly! The experience-that was the word! and it began to fall into
   place. In fact, none of the great founded religions, Christianity,
   Buddhism, Islam, Jainism, Judaism, Zoroastrian-ism, Hinduism, none of them
   began with a philosophical framework or even a main idea. They all began
   with an overwhelming new experience, what Joachim Wach called "the
   experience of the holy," and Max Weber, "possession of the deity," the
   sense of being a vessel of the divine, of the All-one. I remember I never
   truly understood what they were talking about when I first read of such
   things. I just took their weighty German word for it. Jesus, Mani,
   Zoroaster, Gautama Buddha-at the very outset the leader did not offer his
   circle of followers a better state hereafter or an improved social order
   or any reward other than a certain "psychological state in the here and
   now," as Weber put it. I suppose what I never really comprehended was that
   he was talking about an actual mental experience they all went through, an
   ecstasy, in short. In most cases, according to scriptures and legend, it
   happened in a flash. Mohammed fasting and meditating on a mountainside
   near Mecca and--flash!-ecstasy, vast revelation and the beginning of
   Islam. Zoroaster hauling haoma water along the road and--flash!-he runs
   into the flaming form of the Archangel Vohu Mano, messenger of Ahura
   Mazda, and the beginning of Zoroastrianism. Saul of Tarsus walking along
   the road to Damascus and-flash!-he hears the voice of the Lord and becomes
   a Christian. Plus God knows how many lesser figures in the 2,000 years
   since then, Christian Rosenkreuz and his "God-illuminated" brotherhood of
   Rosicrucians, Emanuel Swedenborg whose mind suddenly "opened" in 1743,
   Meister Eck-hart and his disciples Suso and Tauler, and in the
   twentieth-century Sadhu Sundar Singh-with-flash!-a vision at the age of 16
   and many times thereafter; ".. . often when I come out of ecstasy I think
   the whole world must be blind not to see what I see, everything is so near
   and clear ... there is no language which will express the things which I
   see and hear in the spiritual world ..." Sounds like an acid head, of
   course. What they all saw in... a flash was the solution to the basic
   predicament of being human, the personal I, Me, trapped, mortal and
   helpless, in a vast impersonal It, the world around me.
   Suddenly!-All-in-one!-flowing together, I into It, and It into Me, and in
   that flow I perceive a power, so near and so clear, that the whole world
   is blind to. All the modern religions, and the occult mysteries, for that
   matter, talk about an Other World-whether Brahma's or the flying
   saucers'-that the rational work-a-day world is blind to. The-so called!
   friends-rational world. If only they, Mom&Dad&Buddy&Sis, dear-but-square
   ones, could but know the pairos, the supreme moment... The historic
   visions have been explained in many ways, as the result of epilepsy,
   self-hypnosis, changes in metabolism due to fasting, or actual
   intervention by gods-or drugs: Zoroastrianism began in a grand bath of
   haoma water, which was the same as the Hindu soma, and was unquestionably
   a drug. The experience!

   And following the experience-after I got to know the Pranksters, I went
   back and read Joachim Wach's paradigm of the way religions are founded,
   written in 1944, and it was almost like a piece of occult precognition for
   me if I played it off against what I knew about the Pranksters:

   Following a profound new experience, providing a new illumination of the
   world, the founder, a highly charismatic person, begins enlisting
   disciples. These followers become an informally but closely knit
   association, bound together by the new experience, whose nature the
   founder has revealed and interpreted. The association might be called a
   circle, indicating that it is oriented toward a central figure with whom
   each of the followers is in intimate contact. The followers may be
   regarded as the founder's companions, bound to him by personal devotion,
   friendship and loyalty. A growing sense of solidarity both binds the
   members together and differentiates them from any other form of social
   organization. Membership in the circle requires a complete break with the
   ordinary pursuits of life and a radical change in social relationships.
   Ties of family and kinship and loyalties of various kinds were at least
   temporarily relaxed or severed. The hardships, suffering and persecution
   that loomed for those who cast their lot with the group were
   counterbalanced by their high hopes and firm expectations ... and so on.
   And of the founder himself: he has "visions, dreams, trances, frequent
   ecstasies" ... "unusual sensitiveness and an intense emotional life" ...
   "is ready to interpret manifestations of the divine" . . . "there is
   something elemental about [him], an uncompromising attitude and an archaic
   manner and language" . . . "He appears as a renewer of lost contracts with
   the hidden powers of life" .. . "does not usually come from the
   aristocracy, the learned or refined; frequently he emerges from simpler
   folk and remains true to his origin even in a changed environment" ...
   "speaks cryptically, with words, signs, gestures, many metaphors, symbolic
   acts of a diverse nature" . .. "illuminates and interprets the past and
   anticipates the future in terms of the kairos (the supreme moment)"-

   The kairos!-the experience!

   -in one of two ways, according to Max Weber: as an "ethical" prophet, like
   Jesus or Moses, who outlines rules of conduct for his followers and
   describes God as a super-person who passes judgment on how they live up to
   the rules. Or as an "exemplary" prophet, like Buddha: for him, God is
   impersonal, a force, an energy, a unifying flow, an All-in-one. The
   exemplary prophet does not present rules of conduct. He presents his own
   life as an example for his followers . . .

   In all these religious circles, the groups became tighter and tighter by
   developing their own symbols, terminology, life styles, and, gradually,
   simple cultic practices, rites, often involving music and art, all of
   which grew out of the new experience and seemed weird or incomprehensible
   to those who have never had it. At that point they would also ... "develop
   a strong urge to extend the message to all people."

   ... all people ... Within the religious circle, status was always a simple
   matter. The world was simply and sheerly divided into "the aware," those
   who had had the experience of being vessels of the divine, and a great
   mass of "the unaware," "the unmusical," the unattuned." Or: you're either
   on the bus or off the bus. Consciously, the Aware were never snobbish
   toward the Unaware, but in fact most of that great jellyfish blob of
   straight souls looked like hopeless cases-and the music of your flute from
   up top the bus just brought them up tighter. But these groups treated
   anyone who showed possibilities, who was a potential brother, with
   generous solicitude ...

   . . . THE POTENTIALLY ATTUNED . . . BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE started showing up at
   Kesey's in La Honda, and no one was turned away. They could stay there,
   live there, if they ...seemed attuned. Mountain Girl was waiting out front
   of Kesey's house when the bus came around the last bend on Route 84 and
   into the redwood gorge. Mountain Girl was a big brunette with a black
   motorcycle, wearing a T-shirt and dungarees. She was only 18 but big,
   about five-foot-nine, and heavy; and loud and sloppy, as far as that went.
   But it was funny ... she had beautiful teeth and a smile that lit up one's
   gizzard ... Her name was Carolyn Adams, but she became Mountain Girl right
   away. As far as I know, nobody ever called her anything else after that,
   until the police got technical about it nine months later with her and
   eleven other Pranksters...

   Cassady had turned Mountain Girl on to Kesey's place. She had been working
   as a technician in a biological laboratory in Palo Alto. She had a
   boyfriend who-well, he probably thought of himself as a "beatnik" in his
   square hip way. Only he never did anything, this boyfriend of hers. They
   never went anywhere. They never went out. So she went out by herself. She
   ended up one night in St. Michael's Alley, one of Palo Alto's little boho
   rookeries, at a birthday party for Cassady. Cassady said over the mountain
   and down under the redwoods was where it was at.

   Mountain Girl was a big hit with the Pranksters from the very start. She
   seemed always completely out front, without the slightest prompting. She
   was one big loud charge of vitality. Here comes Mountain Girl-and it was a
   thing that made you pick up, as soon as you saw her mouth broaden into a
   grin and her big brown eyes open, open, open, open until they practically
   exploded like sunspots in front of your eyes and you knew that wonderful
   countryfied voice was going to sing out something like:

   "Hey! Guess what we're gonna do! We were just up to Baw's"-the general
   store-"and we're gonna git some seeds and plant some grass in Baw's window
   box! Can't you see it! The whole town's gonna git turned on in six
   months!"-and so on.

   But underneath all the gits and gonnas, she turned out to be probably the
   brightest girl around there, with the possible exception of Faye. Faye
   said very little, so it was a moot point. Mountain Girl turned out to be
   from a highly respectable upper-middle-class background in Poughkeepsie,
   N.Y., a family of Unitarians. In any case, she caught on to everything
   right away. She was decisive and had all the nerve in the world. Also she
   was getting more beautiful every day. All it took was a few weeks of the
   rice and stew and irregular eating around Kesey's, the old involuntary
   macrobiotic diet, so to speak, and she started thinning out and getting
   beautiful. None of this was lost on Kesey. He was the Mountain Man and she
   was the Mountain Girl. She was just right for him ...

   Mountain Girl moved into a tent up on a little plateau on the hill behind
   the house, under the redwoods. Page Browning had a tent up there, too. So
   did Babbs and Gretch. Mike Hagen had his Screw Shack. The Screw Shack was
   a very stellar-Mal Function!-Hagen production. None of the boards lay true
   and none of the nails ever quite made it all the way in. The boards seemed
   to be huddled together in a tentative agreement. One day Kesey took a
   hammer and hit a single nail on the peak of the shack and the whole shack
   fell down.

   "Nothing lasts, Hagen!" yelled Mountain Girl, and her laugh boomed through
   the redwoods.

   And the Hermit's Cave... One day Faye looked out the kitchen window and
   there was a little creature at the foot of the hill behind the house,
   peering out from the edge of the woods like a starved animal. He was a
   small, thin kid, barely five feet tall, but he had a huge black beard,
   like some Ozark g-nome in Barney Google. He just stood there with these
   big starveling eyes bugging out of his wild black shag, looking at the
   house. Faye brought him out a plate of tuna fish. He took it without
   saying anything and ate it; and never left. The Hermit!

   The Hermit hardly ever said anything, but he turned out to be perfectly
   literate, and he would talk to people he trusted, like Kesey. He was only
   18. He had lived with his mother somewhere around La Honda. He had had a
   lot of trouble in school. He had had a lot of trouble everywhere. He was
   the Oddball. Finally he took off for the woods and lived up there
   barefoot, just wearing a shirt and Levi's, killing animals and spearing
   fish for food. People caught glimpses of him now and again and high-school
   kids used to try to hunt him down and demolish his lean-tos and otherwise
   torment him. His wandering had brought him up to the woods up behind
   Kesey's house, a wild stretch that had been designated "Sam McDonald Park"
   but never cleared.

   The Hermit built himself a Hermit's Cave down in a pit in a dark green
   moldy mossy gully that dropped off the path up into the woods. He filled
   it with objects that winked and blinked and cooed. He was also keeper of
   the communal acid stash down there in the cave. And he had other secrets,
   such as his diaries... the Hermit Memoirs, in which real life and his
   Hermit fantasy ran together in wriggling rivers of little boys and lost
   hunters whom only the Hermit could rescue ... Nobody ever knew his real
   name at all until a few months later when, as I say, the police would get
   technical about it...

   Then Babbs discovered Day-Glo, Day-Glo paint, and started painting it up
   the very trunks of the redwoods, great zappers of green, orange, yellow.
   Hell, he even painted the leaves, and Kesey's place began to glow at
   night. And resound. More and more people were showing up for long or short
   stays. Cassady brought in a Scandinavian-style blonde who was always
   talking about hangups. Everybody had hangups. She became June the Goon.
   Then a girl who wore huge floppy red hats and granny glasses, the first
   anybody had ever seen. She became Marge the Barge. Then a sculptor named
   Ron Boise, a thin guy from New England with a nasal accent like Titus
   Moody, only a Titus Moody who spoke the language of Hip: "Man, like, I
   mean, you know," and so on. Boise brought in a sculpture of a hanged man,
   so they ran it up a tree limb with a hangman's noose. He also built a
   great Thunderbird, a great Thor-and-Wotan beaked monster with an amber
   dome on its back and you could get inside of it. Inside were some mighty
   wire strings, which you could pull, which they did, and the Thunderbird
   twanged out across the gorge like the mightiest vibrating bass beast in
   the history of the world. Then he brought in a Kama Sutra sculpture, a
   huge sheetmetal man with his face in the sheetmetal groin of a big
   sheetmetal babe. She had her left leg sticking up in the air. It was
   hollow and Babbs ran a hose up it and turned the water on and it spurted
   out, so they left it running, eternally spurting. It looked like she was
   having an eternal orgasm out of her left foot.

   And ... Sssss-ssss-ssss-Bradley. Bradley, Bradley Hodgeman, had been a
   college tennis star. He was short but very muscular. He turned up-or came
   on, Bradley was always coming on-acting so weird, people would stand there
   and look at him, even at Kesey's. He talked in clots of words, "Fell down
   by the wino station-insoluble flying objects, nitrate-creasey greens by
   the back porch-Ray Bradbury interlining of the lone chrome nostril, you
   understand"-sidling through the room with a nonspecific grin on and his
   hair combed down over his face like a surfer, his back hunched over, and
   then going into a stopped-up laugh, Sssss-ssss-ssss-ssss-until somebody
   would try to break up his sequence by asking him how was the tennis
   playing going these days and he would widen his grin and open his eyes to
   a horizon of vast significance and say, "One day I hit the ball up in the
   air ... and it never came down ... Sssss-ssss--ssss--ssss..."

   ACTUALLY, THERE WERE A LOT OF KIDS IN THE EARLY 1960S who were ... yes;
   attuned. I used to think of them as the Beautiful People because of the
   Beautiful People letters they used to write their parents. They were
   chiefly in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York City, these kids. They
   had a regular circuit they were on, and there was a lot of traffic from
   city to city. Most of them were from middle-class backgrounds, but not
   upper bourgeois, more petit bourgeois, if that old garbanzo can stand
   being written down again-homes with Culture but no money or money but no
   Culture. At least that was the way it struck me, judging by the Beautiful
   People I knew. Culture, Truth, and Beauty were important to them . .. "Art
   is a creed, not a craft," as somebody said ... Young! Immune! Christ,
   somehow there was enough money floating around in the air so that one
   could do this thing, live together with other kids-Our own thing!-from our
   own status sphere, without having to work at a job, and live on our own
   terms-Us! and people our age!-it was... beautiful, it was a... whole
   feeling, and the straight world never understood it, this thing of one's
   status sphere and how one was only nineteen, twenty, twenty-one,
   twenty-two or so and not starting out helpless at the bottom of the
   ladder, at all, because the hell with the ladder itself-one was already up
   on a ... level that the straight world was freaking baffled by! Straight
   people were always trying to figure out what is wrong here-never having
   had this feeling themselves. Straight people called them beatniks. I
   suppose the Beautiful People identified with the Beat Generation
   excitement of the late 1950s, but in fact there was a whole new motif in
   their particular bohemian status sphere: namely, psychedelic drugs.

   El... Es... Dee ... se-cret-ly ... Timothy Leary, Alpert, and a few
   chemists like Al Hubbard and the incognito "Dr. Spaulding" had been
   pumping LSD out into the hip circuit with a truly messianic conviction.
   LSD, peyote, mescaline, morning-glory seeds were becoming the secret new
   thing in the hip life. A lot of kids who were into it were already piled
   into amputated apartments, as I called them. The seats, the tables, the
   beds-none of them ever had legs. Communal living on the floor, you might
   say, although nobody used terms like "communal living" or "tribes" or any
   of that. They had no particular philosophy, just a little leftover
   Buddhism and Hinduism from the beat period, plus Huxley's theory of
   opening doors in the mind, no distinct life style, except for the Legless
   look ... They were ... well, Beautiful People!-not "students," "clerks,"
   "salesgirls," "executive trainees"-Christ, don't give me your
   occupation-game labels! we are Beautiful People, ascendent from your robot
   junkyard :::::: and at this point they used to sit down and write home the
   Beautiful People letter. Usually the girls wrote these letters to their
   mothers. Mothers all over California, all over America, I guess, got to
   know the Beautiful People letter by heart. It went:

   "Dear Mother,

   "I meant to write to you before this and I hope you haven't been worried.
   I am in [San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Arizona, a Hopi Indian
   Reservation!!!! New York, Ajijic, San Miguel de Allende, Mazatlan, Mexico!
   ! ! !] and it is really beautiful here. It is a beautiful scene. We've
   been here a week. I won't bore you with the whole thing, how it happened,
   but I really tried, because I knew you wanted me to, but it just didn't
   work out with [school, college, my job, me and Danny] and so I have come
   here and it a really beautiful scene. I don't want you to worry about me.
   I have met some Beautiful People and ..."

   ... and in the heart of even the most unhip mamma in all the U.S. of A.
   instinctively goes up the adrenal shriek: beatniks, bums, spades-dope.

   at Kesey's the days began - when? there were no clocks around and nobody
   had a watch. The lime light would be sparkling down through the redwoods
   when you woke up. The first sounds, usually, would be Faye calling the
   children-"Jed! Shannon!"-or a cabinet door slamming in the kitchen or a
   pan being put down on the drainboard. Faye the eternal-Then maybe a car
   coming over the wooden bridge and parking in the dirt area out front of
   the house. Sometimes it would be one of the regulars, like Hagen, coming
   back. He was always going off somewhere. Sometimes it would be the
   everlasting visitors, from god knows where, friends of friends of friends,
   curiosity seekers, some of them, dope seekers, some of them, kids from
   Berkeley, you could never tell. People around the house would just start
   to be getting up. Kesey emerges in his undershorts, walks out front to the
   creek and dives in that mothering cold water, by way of shocking himself
   awake. George Walker is sitting on the porch with just a pair of Levi's
   on, going over his muscles, his arms, shoulders and torso and all the
   muscles, with his hands, looking for flaws, picking off hickies, sort of
   like the ministrations of a cat. There would be a great burst of activity
   in the late afternoon, people working on various projects, the most
   complicated of which, endless, it seemed like, was The Movie.

   The Pranksters spent much of the fall of 1964, and the winter, and the
   early spring of 1965, working on ... The Movie. They had about forty-five
   hours of color film from the bus trip, and once they got to going over it,
   it was a monster. Kesey had high hopes for the film, on every level. It
   was the world's first acid film, taken under conditions of total
   spontaneity barreling through the heartlands of America, recording all
   now, in the moment. The current fantasy was... a total breakthrough in
   terms of expression ... but also something that would amaze and delight
   many multitudes, a movie that could be shown commercially as well as in
   the esoteric world of the heads. But The Movie was a monster, as I say.
   The sheer labor and tedium in editing forty-five hours of film was
   unbelievable. And besides... much of the film was out of focus. Hagen,
   like everybody else, had been soaring half the time, and the bouncing of
   the bus hadn't helped especially-but that was the trip! Still... Also,
   there were very few establishing shots, shots showing where the bus was
   when this or that took place. But who needs that old Hollywood thing of
   long shot, medium shot, closeup, and the careful cuts and wipes and pans
   and dolly in and dolly out, the old bullshit. Still... plunging in on
   those miles of bouncing, ricocheting, blazing film with a splicer was like
   entering a jungle where the greeny vines grew faster than you could chop
   them down in front of you.

   The film had already cost a staggering sum, about $70,000, mostly for
   color processing. Kesey had put everything he had gotten from his two
   novels plus the play adaptation of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest into
   Intrepid Trips, Inc. His brother, Chuck, who had a good creamery business
   in Springfield, Oregon, invested to some extent. George Walker's father
   had set up a trust fund for him, with strings on it, but he contributed
   when he could. By the end of 1965, according to Faye's bookkeeping,
   Intrepid Trips, Inc., had spent $103,000 on the various Prankster
   enterprises. Living expenses for the whole group ran to about $20,000 for
   the year, a low figure considering that there were seldom fewer than ten
   people around to be taken care of and usually two or three vehicles. Food
   and lodging were all taken care of by Kesey.

   A pot of money at the front door-There was a curious little library
   building up on the shelves in the living room, books of science fiction
   and other mysterious things, and you could pick up almost any of these
   books and find truly strange vibrations. The whole thing here is so much
   like... this book on Kesey's shelf, Robert Heinlein's novel, Stranger in a
   Strange Land. It is bewildering. It is as if Heinlein and the Pranksters
   were bound together by some inexplicable acausal connecting bond. This is
   a novel about a Martian who comes to earth, a true Superhero, in fact,
   born of an Earth mother and father after a space flight from Earth to
   Mars, but raised by infinitely superior beings, the Martians. Beings on
   other planets are always infinitely superior in science-fiction novels.
   Anyway, around him gathers a mystic brotherhood, based on a mysterious
   ceremony known as water-sharing. They live in-La Honda! At Kesey's! Their
   place is called the Nest. Their life transcends all the usual earthly
   games of status, sex, and money. No one who once shares water and partakes
   of life in the Nest ever cares about such banal competitions again. There
   is a pot of money inside the front door, provided by the Superhero ...
   Everything is totally out front in the Nest-no secrets, no guilt, no
   jealousies, no putting anyone down for anything: "... a plural marriage-a
   group theogamy ... Therefore whatever took place-or was about to take
   place ... was not public but private. 'Ain't nobody here but us gods'-so
   how could anyone be offended? Bacchanalia, unashamed swapping, communal
   living . .. everything."

   Kesey by now had not only the bus but the very woods wired for sound.
   There were wires running up the hillside into the redwoods and microphones
   up there that could pick up random sounds. Up in the redwoods atop the
   cliff on the other side of the highway from the house were huge speakers,
   theater horns, that could flood the entire gorge with sound. Roland Kirk
   and his half a dozen horns funking away in the old sphenoid saxophone
   sinus cavities of the redwoods.

   Dusk! Huge stripes of Day-Glo green and orange ran up the soaring redwoods
   and gleamed out at dusk as if Nature had said at last, Aw freak it, and
   had freaked out. Up the gully back of the house, up past the Hermit's
   Cave, were Day-Glo face masks and boxes and machines and things that
   glowed, winked, hummed, whistled, bellowed, and microphones that could
   pick up animals, hermits, anything, and broadcast them from the treetops,
   like the crazy gibbering rhesus background noises from the old Jungle Jim
   radio shows. Dusk!  At dusk a man could put on something like a World War
   I aviator's helmet, only painted in screaming Day-Glo, and with his face
   painted in Day-Glo constellations, the bear, the goat, a great walking
   Day-Glo hero in the dusky rusky forests, and he could orate in the deep of
   the forest, up the hill, only in spectral tones, like the Shadow, any old
   message, something like: "This is control tower, this is control tower,
   clear Runway One, the cougar microbes approach, bleeding antique lint from
   every pore and begging for high octane, beware, be aware, all ye who sleep
   in barracks on the main strip, the lumps in your mattress are carnivore
   spores, venereal butterflies sent by the Combine to mothproof your brain,
   a pro-kit in every light socket-Plug up the light sockets! The cougar
   microbes are marching in like army ants.. . "-happy to know that someone,
   somebody, might answer from the house, or some place, 6ver another
   microphone, booming over the La Honda hills: "May day, May day, collapse
   the poles at every joint, hide inside your folding rules, calibrate your
   brains for the head count..." And Bob Dylan raunched and rheumed away in
   the sphenoids or some damned place-

   By nightfall the Pranksters are in the house and a few joints are
   circulating, saliva-liva-liva-liva-liva, and the whole thing is getting
   deeper into the moment, as it were, and people are working on tapes, tapes
   being played back, stopped, rewound, played again, a click on the plastic
   lever, stopped again ... and a little speed making the rounds-such a
   lordly surge under the redwoods!-tablets of Benzedrine and Dexedrine,
   mainly, and you take off for a burst of work and rapping into the night.
   .. experiments of all sorts favored here, like putting contact microphones
   up against the bare belly and listening to the enzymes gurgling. Most
   Prankster bellies go gurgle-galumph-blub and so on, but Cassady's goes
   ping!-dingaping!-ting! as if he were wired at 78 rpm and everyone else is
   at 33 rpm, which seems about right. And then they play a tape against a
   television show. That is, they turn on the picture on the TV, the Ed
   Sullivan Show, say, but they turn off the sound and play a tape of, say,
   Babbs and somebody rapping off each other's words. The picture of the Ed
   Sullivan Show and the words on the tape suddenly force your mind to reach
   for connections between two vastly different orders of experience. On the
   TV screen, Ed Sullivan is holding Ella Fitzgerald's hands with his hands
   sopped over her hands as if her hands were the first robins of spring, and
   his lips are moving, probably saying, "Ella, that was wonderful! Really
   wonderful! Ladies and gentlemen, another hand for a great, great lady!"
   But the voice that comes out is saying to Ella Fitzgerald-in perfect
   synch-"The lumps in your mattress are carnivore spores, venereal
   butterflies sent by the Combine to mothproof your brain, a pro-kit in
   every light socket-Ladies and gentlemen, Plug up the light sockets! Plug
   up the light sockets! The cougar microbes are marching in ... "

   Perfect! The true message!-

   -although this kind of weird synchronization usually struck outsiders as
   mere coincidence or just whimsical, meaningless in any case. They couldn't
   understand why the Pranksters grooved on it so. The inevitable confusion
   of the unattuned-like most of the Pranksters' unique practices, it derived
   from the LSD experience and was incomprehensible without it. Under LSD, if
   it really went right, Ego and Non-Ego started to merge. Countless things
   that seemed separate started to merge, too: a sound became ... a color!
   blue ... colors became smells, walls began to breathe like the underside
   of a leaf, with one's own breath. A curtain became a column of concrete
   and yet it began rippling, this incredible concrete mass rippling in
   harmonic waves like the Puget Sound bridge before the crash and you can
   feel it, the entire harmonics of the universe from the most massive to the
   smallest and most personal-presque vu!-all flowing together in this very
   moment...

   This side of the LSD experience-the feeling!-tied in with Jung's theory of
   synchronicity. Jung tried to explain the meaningful coincidences that
   occur in life and cannot be explained by cause-and-effect reasoning, such
   as ESP phenomena. He put forth the hypothesis that the unconscious
   perceives certain archetypical patterns that elude the conscious mind.
   These patterns, he suggested, are what unite subjective or psychic events
   with objective phenomena, the Ego with the Non-Ego, as in psychosomatic
   medicine or in the microphysical events of modern physics in which the eye
   of the beholder becomes an integral part of the experiment. Countless
   philosophers, prophets, early scientists, not to mention alchemists and
   occultists, had tried to present the same idea in the past, Plotinus,
   Lao-tse, Pico della Mirandola, Agrippa, Kepler, Leibniz. Every phenomenon,
   and every person, is a microcosm of the whole pattern of the universe,
   according to this idea. It is as if each man were an atom in a molecule in
   a fingernail of a giant being. Most men spend their lives trying to
   understand the workings of the molecule they're born into and all they
   know for sure are the cause-and-effect workings of the atoms in it. A few
   brilliant men grasp the structure of the entire fingernail. A few
   geniuses, like Einstein, may even see that they're all part of a finger of
   some !sort-So space equals time, hmmmmmm ... All the while, however, many
   men get an occasional glimpse of another fingernail from another finger
   flashing by or even a whole finger or even the surface of the giant
   being's face and they realize instinctively that this is a part of a
   pattern they're all involved in, although they are totally powerless to
   explain it by cause and effect. And then-some visionary, through some
   accident-

   -accident, Mahavira?-

   -through some quirk of metabolism, through some drug perhaps, has his
   doors of perception opened for an instant and he almost sees-presque
   vu!-the entire being and he knows for the first time that there is a whole
   . . . other pattern here .. . Each moment in his life is only minutely
   related to the cause-and-effect chain within his little molecular world.
   Each moment, if he could only analyze it, reveals the entire pattern of
   the motion of the giant being, and his life is minutely synched in with
   it-

   - And when the Chevron tanker follows the bus into ... nowhere . . . one
   gets a glimpse of the pattern, a new level . . . many levels here . . .

   The Pranksters never talked about synchronicity by name, but they were
   more and more attuned to the principle. Obviously, according to this
   principle, man does not have free will. There is no use in his indulging
   in a lifelong competition to change the structure of the little
   environment he seems to be trapped in. But one could see the larger
   pattern and move with it-Go with the flow!-and accept it and rise above
   one's immediate environment and even alter it by accepting the larger
   pattern and grooving with it-Put your good where it will do the most!

   Gradually the Prankster attitude began to involve the main things
   religious mystics have always felt, things common to Hindus, Buddhists,
   Christians, and for that matter Theosophists and even flying-saucer
   cultists. Namely, the experiencing of an Other World, a higher level of
   reality. And a perception of the cosmic unity of this higher level. And a
   feeling of timelessness, the feeling that what we know as time is only the
   result of a naive faith in causality-the notion that A in the past caused
   B in the present, which will cause C in the future, when actually A, B,
   and C are all part of a pattern that can be truly understood only by
   opening the doors of perception and experiencing it... in this moment .. .
   this supreme moment. . . this kairos-

   For a long time I couldn't understand the one Oriental practice the
   Pranksters liked, the throwing of the I Ching coins. The I Ching is an
   ancient Chinese text. The Book of Changes, it is  called. It contains 64
   oracular readings, all highly metaphorical. You ask the I Ching a question
   and throw three coins three times and come up with a hexagram and a number
   that points to one of the passages. It "answers" your question. .. yes;
   but the I Ching didn't seem very Pranksterlike. I couldn't fit it in with
   the Pranksters' wired-up, American-flag-flying, Day-Glo electro-pastel
   surge down the great American superhighway. Yet-of course! The I  Ching
   was supremely the book of  Now, of the moment. For, as Jung said, the way
   the coins fall is inevitably tied up with the quality of the entire moment
   in which they fall, the entire pattern, and "form a part of it-a part that
   is insignificant to us, yet most meaningful to Chinese minds" ... these
   things

   THAT ONLY LUCKY DOGS AND MERRY PRANKSTERS HEAR-and SO many mysteries of
   the synch from that time on .. . There is another book in the shelf in
   Kesey's living room that everybody seems to look at, a little book called
   The Journey to the East, by Hermann Hesse. Hesse wrote it in 1932 and
   yet... the synch!...  it is a book about.. . exactly ... the Pranksters!
   and the great bus trip of 1964! "It was my destiny to join in a great
   experience," the book began. "Having had the good fortune to belong to the
   League, I was permitted to be a participant in a unique journey." It goes
   on to tell about a weird, circuitous journey across Europe, toward the
   East, that the members of this League took. It began, supposedly, as just
   a journey, to get from here to there, but gradually it took on a profound
   though unclassifiable meaning: "My happiness did indeed arise from the
   same secret as the happiness in dreams; it arose from the freedom to
   experience everything imaginable simultaneously, to exchange outward and
   inward easily, to move Time and Space about like scenes in a theater. And
   as we League brothers traveled throughout the world without motor-cars or
   ships, as we conquered the war-shattered world by our faith and
   transformed it into Paradise, we creatively brought the past, the future
   and the fictitious into the present moment." The present moment! Now! The
   kairos! It was like the man had been on acid himself and was on the bus.

   EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT THEY HELD A BRIEFING. BRIEFING WAS Babbs's term, from
   his military days in Vietnam. Faye fixes some supper of rice and beans and
   meat, kind of a stew, and they all go into the kitchen and dig into the
   pots and put some on a plate and eat. A few joints are circulating around,
   saliva-liva-liva-liva-liva. Then they all go up to one of the tents on the
   plateau, Page's, and they all crowd in there, sitting this way and that
   with their legs pulled up under their chins and they start throwing out
   this and that subject for discussions. Curiously, this is like summer
   camp, on one level, the Honor Council meeting out in the woods after
   supper, everything smelling of charred firewood and canvas damp with dew,
   and crickets and cicadas sounding off and people slapping their ankles
   from mosquitoes and bugs and shit. On the other hand, the smell of
   new-mown grass burning and ... the many levels... aren't particularly
   summer camp. They usually wait for Kesey to start off. He usually starts
   off with something specific, something he's seen, something he's been
   doing . .. and builds up to what he's been thinking.

   He starts talking about the lag systems he is trying to work out with tape
   recorders. Out in the backhouse he has variable lag systems in which a
   microphone broadcasts over a speaker, and in front of the speaker is a
   second microphone. This microphone picks up what you just broadcast, but
   an instant later. If you wear earphones from the second speaker, you can
   play off against the sound of what you've just said, as in an echo. Or you
   can do the things with tapes, running the tape over the sound heads of two
   machines before it's wound on the takeup reel, or you can use three
   microphones and three speakers, four tape recorders and four sound heads,
   and on and on, until you get a total sense of the lag...

   A person has all sorts of lags built into him, Kesey is saying. One, the
   most basic, is the sensory lag, the lag between the time your senses
   receive something and you are able to react. One-thirtieth of a second is
   the time it takes, if you're the most alert person alive, and most people
   are a lot slower than that. Now, Cassady is right up against that 1/30th
   of a second barrier. He is going as fast as a human can go, but even he
   can't overcome it. He is a living example of how close you can come, but
   it can't be done. You can't go any faster than that. You can't through
   sheer speed overcome the lag. We are all of us doomed to spend our lives
   watching a movie of our lives-we are always acting on what has just
   finished happening. It happened at least 1/30th of a second ago. We think
   we're in the present, but we aren't. The present we know is only a movie
   of the past, and we will really never be able to control the present
   through ordinary means. That lag has to be overcome some other way,
   through some kind of total breakthrough. And there are all sorts of other
   lags, besides, that go along with it. There are historical and social
   lags, where people are living by what their ancestors or somebody else
   perceived, and they may be twenty-five or fifty years or centuries behind,
   and nobody can be creative without overcoming all those lags first of all.
   A person can overcome that much through intellect or theory or study of
   history and so forth and get pretty much into the present that way, but
   he's still going to be up against one of the worst lags of all, the
   psychological. Your emotions remain behind because of training, education,
   the way you were brought up, blocks, hangups and stuff like that, and as a
   result your mind wants to go one way but your emotions don't-

   Cassady speaks up: "Blue noses, red eyes, and that's all there is to say
   about that." And, for once, he stops right there.

   But of course!-the whole emotional lag-and Cassady, voluble King Vulcan
   himself, has suddenly put it all into one immediate image, like a Zen poem
   or an early Pound poem-hot little animal red eyes bottled up by cold
   little blue nose hangups-

   Cassady's disciple, Bradley, says: "God is red"-and even he stops right
   there. The sonofabitch is on for once-it is all compacted into those three
   words, even shorter than Cassady's line, like Bradley didn't even have to
   think it out, it just came out, a play on the phrase God is dead, only
   saying, for those of us on to the analogical thing, God is not dead, God
   is red, God is the bottled-up red animal inside all of us, whole,
   all-feeling, complete, out front, only it is made dead by all the lags-

   Kesey giggles slightly and says, "I think maybe we're really synched up
   tonight"-

   Somebody starts talking about some kid they know who has been busted for
   possession, of grass, and the cops said something to him and he said
   something back and the cops started beating on him. Everybody commiserates
   with the poor incarcerated bastard and they comment on the unfortunate
   tendency cops have of beating up on people, and Babbs says,

   "Yeah! Yeah! Right! Right! Right!-but that's in his movie."

   In his movie-right right right-and they all grok over that. Grok-and then
   it's clear, without anybody having to say it. Everybody, everybody
   everywhere, has his own movie going, his own scenario, and everybody is
   acting his movie out like mad, only most people don't know that is what
   they're trapped by, their little script. Everybody looks around inside the
   tent and nobody says it out loud, because nobody has to. Yet everybody
   knows at once ::::: somehow this ties in, synchs, directly with what Kesey
   has just said about the movie screen of our perceptions that closes us out
   from our own reality ::::: and somehow synchs directly, at the same time,
   in this very moment, with the actual, physical movie, The Movie, that they
   have been slaving over, the great morass of a movie, with miles and miles
   of spiraling spliced-over film and hot splices billowing around them like
   so many intertwined, synched, but still chaotic and struggling human
   lives, theirs, the whole fucking world's-in this very moment-Cassady in
   his movie, called Speed Limit, he is both a head whose thing is speed,
   meaning amphetamines, and a unique being whose quest is Speed, faster,
   goddamn it, spiraling, jerking, kicking, fibrillating tight up against the
   V30 of a second movie-screen barrier of our senses, trying to get into...
   Now-

   -Mountain Girl's movie is called Big Girl, and her scenario stars a girl
   who grew up being the big surging powerful girl in genteel surroundings,
   oh, fin de siecle Poughkeepsie, N.Y., oh Vassar scholars, and who didn't
   fit into whatever they had in mind for delicate girls in striped
   seersucker jumpers in faint ratcheting watersprinkler sun jewels on the
   water drops on the green grass Poughkeepsie, a big girl who's got to break
   out and she gets good and loud and brassy to come on stronger in this
   unequal contest-and later in the plot finds out she is bigger in quite
   another way, and bright, and beautiful.. .

   ... One looks around, and one sees the Hermit, huddled up here inside the
   tent, Hermit whom all love but he gets on nerves-why?-and they say Fuck
   off, Hermit, after which they regret it, and his movie is called
   Everybody's Bad Trip. He is everybody's bad trip, he takes it upon
   himself, he takes your bad trip for you, the worst way you thought it
   could happen-

   And Page, with his black jacket with the Iron Cross on it, his movie is
   called-of course!-Zea-lot. It is as if everyone in here, smelling the
   burning grass, suddenly remembers a dream Page told them he had while he
   was sleeping on a cot in a jail in Arizona for, er, turning the citizens
   on to Dimensional Kreemo, yes, well-in this dream a young man named
   Zea-lot came to town, dressed in black, and he inflamed the citizens into
   doing all the secret fiend things they most dreaded letting themselves do,
   like staving in the windows of the Fat Jewelry Co., Inc., and
   sco-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ping it up, like jumping little high-assed mulatto
   wenches, doing all the forbidden things, led on, encouraged, onward,
   upward, by the burning shiny black horseman, Zealot-after which, in the
   freaking cold blue morning after, they all look at each each-who did
   this?-who did all this dope-taking and looting and shafting?-what in the
   name of God came over us?-what came over this town?-well--shit!-it wasn't
   us, it was him, he infected and inflamed our brains, that damned snake,
   Zea-lot-and they charge down the street alternately beating their breasts
   and their bald heads, yelling for the hide of Zealot, crying out his name
   as the ultimate infamy-while Zea-lot just rides off nonchalantly into the
   black noon, and they just have to watch his black back and the black ass
   of his horse receding over the next hill, taking the crusade on to ....
   turn on ... the next town ...

   . . . yes . . .

   "Yeah, we're really synched up tonight."

   -and, of course, everyone in this tent looks at Kesey and wonders. What is
   his movie? Well, you might call it Randle McMur-phy, for a start.
   McMurphy, goading, coaxing, leading everybody on to give themselves a
   little bigger movie, a little action, moving the plot from out of deadass
   snug harbor. There's a hell of a scene going for you, bub, out here in
   Edge City. But don't even stop there-

   -and all those things are keeping us out of the present, Kesey is saying,
   out of our own world, our own reality, and until we can get into our own
   world, we can't control it. If you ever make that breakthrough, you'll
   know it. It'll be like you had a player piano, and it is playing a mile a
   minute, with all the keys sinking in front of you in fantastic chords, and
   you never heard of the song before, but you are so far into the thing,
   your hands start going along with it exactly. When you make that
   breakthrough, then you'll start controlling the piano-

   --and extend the message to all people-

   You are hereby empowered ::::::::::::

   By now the Pranksters had built up so much momentum they begin to feel
   immune even to a very obvious danger, namely, the cops.

   The citizens of La Honda were becoming more and more exercised about Kesey
   and the Pranksters, and so were the San Mateo County sheriff and federal
   narcotics officials. Not knowing what the hell accounted for the crazy
   life at Kesey's place, they apparently assumed there was some hard drug
   use going on-heroin, cocaine, morphine. Late in 1964 they put Kesey's
   place under surveillance. The Pranksters knew about it and used to play
   games with the cops. The main federal narcotics agent in the area was a
   San Francisco Chinese, Agent William Wong. The Pranksters made a huge sign
   and put it up on the house:

                              We're Clean, Willie!

   It was fun, the cop game. The cops would be out in the woods at night,
   along the creek, and one of them would step into the creek and get his
   feet wet and say something. The Pranksters would pick all this up on the
   remote mikes in the woods, whereupon the voice of Mountain Girl,
   broadcasting from inside the cabin, would jeer out over an amplifier up in
   the redwoods: "Hey! Why don't you come in the house and dry off your feet,
   you cops! Quit playing the cop game and come in and git some nice hot
   coffee!"

   The cops were just playing their eternal cop game. That's all it seemed
   like to the Pranksters.

   About April 21, 1965, the Pranksters got a tip that a warrant had been
   drawn up and the cops were going to raid. Delightful! The cops were really
   going to play their game right up to their BB gun eyeballs. The Pranksters
   put up a great sign at the front gate

                 No Admittance. Five-Day Countdown in Progress

   as if they were embarked upon the damnedest, most awfulest dope orgy brain
   blowout in the history of the world. In fact, they set about making the
   premises clean. On the third day of the countdown, April 23, 1965, 10:50
   p.m., the raid came. Oh God, there was never a better game played by any
   cops. Here they were, the absolute perfect cop-game cops, the sheriff,
   seventeen deputies, Federal Agent Wong, eight police dogs, cars, wagons,
   guns, posses, ropes, walkie-talkies, bullhorns-Cosmo! the whole freaking
   raid scene-and right up to the end the Pranksters played it as they saw
   it: namely, as a high farce, an opera bouffe. The cops claimed they caught
   Kesey trying to flush a batch of marijuana down the toilet. Kesey claimed
   he was only in there painting flowers on the toilet bowl. The bathroom was
   already a madhouse collage of photos, clippings, murals, mandalas, every
   weird thing in the world, like an indoor version of the bus, and the cops
   crashed in and Agent Wong grabbed Kesey from behind. Kesey was later
   booked on a charge of resisting arrest, among other charges, to which he
   said that he had been in the bathroom and some unidentified male came up
   and embraced him from behind, and so naturally he slugged him. It was a
   laugh and a half. Kesey's resistance, he said, upended Wong and hurtled
   him into the bathtub on top of Page Browning, who was taking a bath.
   Browning was arrested for resisting arrest, too. It was too much.

   Even after the raiders had everybody in there, thirteen people, lined up
   against the walls, and were searching them for drugs, it was just the most
   wacked-out cop game anybody had ever seen any cops play. One of the
   raiders reached into Mike Hagen's pocket, and when he drew his hand out,
   it held a vial of some clear liquid, whereupon all the Pranksters started
   shouting: "Hey! Play fair! Play fair! Be fair cops! Play hard but play
   fair"-and so on. The vial, whatever it was or was supposed to be, was
   never heard of again. In a tool box outside, the raiders found a
   hypodermic syringe full of some kind of liquid-which turned out to be
   Three-in-One Oil for oiling the tape-recorder mechanisms-and Kesey and
   twelve others, including Babbs, Gretch, Hagen, Walker, Mountain Girl,
   Page, Cassady, and the Hermit, were booked on many charges, including
   possession of marijuana and narcotics paraphernalia (the syringe),
   resisting arrest and impairing the morals of minors (Mountain Girl and the
   Hermit). Even then, the whole thing became not much more than the
   cop-and-jailhouse-and-judge-and-lawyer game, with such high moments as
   when they all got bailed out and emerged from the jail in San Mateo and
   the Hermit's mother appeared. Hermit, they discovered from the police
   blotter, was named Anthony Dean Wells. Nobody had ever asked him what his
   name was. Anyway, his mother slapped Kesey across the face with a
   paperback edition of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and screamed, "Go
   back to your cuckoo pad! You should have stayed in the nest instead of
   flying over it, you big cuckoo!"

   Well, the whole thing was too much. When the cops booked them, Babbs gave
   his occupation as "movie producer," and Mountain Girl said she was a
   "movie technician." So Babbs solemnly appeared in the local newspapers as
   the big movie producer caught in the raid along with the big novelist,
   Kesey. It was something. The San Francisco newspapers took a very lively
   interest in the case and sent people out to interview Kesey within the
   Dope Den, and word of the Prankster life style was made public, however
   obliquely, for the first time.

   The publicity couldn't have been better, at least in terms of the
   hip-intellectual circles where the Pranksters might hope to have some
   immediate influence. Accusing somebody of possession of marijuana was like
   saying "I saw him take a drink." Kesey was referred to as a kind of
   "hipster Christ," "a modern mystic," after the model of Jack Kerouac and
   William Burroughs. As all could plainly read in the press, Kesey had gone
   even further. He had stopped writing. He was now working on a vast
   experimental movie entitled-the newspapers solemnly reported-Intrepid
   Traveler and His Merry Pranksters Leave in Search of a Cool Place.
   "Writers," he told a reporter, "are trapped by artificial rules. We are
   trapped in syntax. We are ruled by an imaginary teacher with a red
   ball-point pen who will brand us with an A-minus for the slightest
   infraction of the rules. Even Cuckoo seems like an elaborate commercial."

   LSD was never mentioned in all this. Kesey came off chiefly as a visionary
   who had forsaken his riches and his career as a novelist in order to
   explore new forms of expression. In the California press he graduated from
   mere literary fame to celebrity. If the purpose of the raid was to stamp
   out dopeniks-the cop game couldn't have backfired more completely.

   After Kesey and the Pranksters got out on bail, the legal wrangling went
   on interminably-but they all stayed free. Kesey had a team of aggressive,
   bright young lawyers working on the case, Zonker's brother-in-law Paul
   Robertson in San Jose, and Pat Hallinan and Brian Rohan from San
   Francisco. Hallinan was the son of Vincent Hallinan, the lawyer, a famous
   champion of the underdog. By and by the charges were dropped against
   everybody but Kesey and Page Browning, and even they ended up with only
   one charge lodged against them, possession of marijuana. They trooped down
   to Redwood City, the San Mateo County Seat, fifteen times during the last
   eight months of 1965, by Rohan's count. It was interminable, but they all
   stayed free . ..

   Yes! And heads, kids, kooks, intellectual tourists of all sorts, started
   heading for Kesey's in La Honda.

   Even Sandy Lehmann-Haupt returned. About a year had gone by and he was
   O.K. again and he flew into San Francisco. Kesey and four or five other
   Pranksters drove to the San Francisco Airport to meet him. As they drove
   back to La Honda, Sandy cheerfully gave a brief account of what had
   happened to him in Big Sur before he split like he did.

   "-then I started having dream wars... with somebody," said Sandy. He
   didn't want to say who.

   "Yeah, I know," said Kesey. "With me."

   He knew!

   And the mysto fogs began to roll in again off the bay ...

   NORMAN HARTWEG AND HIS FRIEND EVAN ENGBER DROVE UP to La Honda from Los
   Angeles with the idea of doing the Tibetan thing for a few weeks and
   seeing what it was all about. That was pretty funny, the idea of doing the
   Tibetan thing at Kesey's. Nevertheless, that was Norman's idea. Norman was
   a 17-year-old playwright from Ann Arbor, Michigan. He was a thin guy, five
   feet seven, with a thin face and sharp features and a beard. But his nose
   tilted up slightly, which gave him a boyish look. He was eking out a
   living by writing a column for the Los Angeles Free Press, a weekly, the
   L.A. counterpart of the Village Voice, and working on avant-garde films,
   and living in a room underneath the dance floor of a discotheque on the
   Sunset Strip. He had run into Kesey's friend Susan Brustman and then into
   Kesey himself, and Kesey had invited him up to La Honda to edit The Movie
   and ... partake of the life ... Somehow Norman got the idea the people at
   Kesey's were like, you know, monks, novitiates; a lot of meditating with
   your legs crossed, chanting, eating rice, feeling vibrations, walking
   softly over the forest floor and thinking big. Why else would they be out
   in the woods in the middle of nowhere?

   So Norman drove up from L.A. with Evan Engber, who was a theater director,
   occasionally, and, later, a member of Dr. West's Jug Band, and, as a
   matter of fact, the husband of Yvette Mimieux the movie actress. They
   drove up the coastal route, California Route 1, then cut over Route 84 at
   San Gregorio and on up into the redwood forests; around a bend, and
   they're at Kesey's. But jesus, somehow it doesn't look very Tibetan. It
   isn't the hanged man in the tree so much, or the statue of a guy eating
   it. Hell, there are no flies on the Tibetans. It is more the odd detail
   here and there. Kesey's mailbox, for example, which is red, white, and
   blue, the Stars and Stripes. And a big framed sign on top of the house: We
   Wuz Framed. And the front gate, across the wooden bridge. The gate is made
   of huge woodcutter's saw blades and has a death mask on it-and a big sign,
   about 15 feet long, that reads: The Merry Pranksters Welcome the Hell's
   Angels. Music is blasting out of some speakers on top of the house, a
   Beatles record-Help, I ne-e-e-ed somebody-

   At that moment, that very moment, Engber gets a stabbing pain in his left
   shoulder.

   "I don't know what it is, Norman," he says, "but it's killing  me. "

   They drive on in across the bridge and get out and go into the house
   looking for Kesey. Brown dogs belly through the flea clouds outside the
   house, coughing fruit flies. Engber clutches his shoulder. Inside, bright
   green-and-gold light streams in through the French doors onto the
   damnedest clutter. There are big pipes hanging down from the rafters in
   the main room, a whole row of them, like some enormous vertical xylophone.
   Also dolls, dolls hanging from the rafters, re-assembled dolls, dolls with
   the heads sticking out of a hip joint, a leg out of the neck joint, arm
   out of other leg joint, leg out of shoulder joint, and so on, and a
   Day-Glo navel. Also balloons, also Chianti bottles stuck on the rafters at
   weird angles somehow, as if they had been in the very process of falling
   to the floor and suddenly they froze there. And on the floor, on the
   chairs, on tables, on the couch, toys, and tape recorders, and pieces of
   tape recorders, and pieces of pieces of tape recorders, and movie
   equipment, and pieces of pieces of pieces of movie equipment, and tapes
   and film running all over the place, plaited in among wires and sockets,
   all of it in great spiral tangles, great celluloid billows, and a big
   piece of a newspaper headline cut out and stuck up on the wall: Hail to
   All Edges ... In the midst of all this, sitting toward the side, is a
   gangling girl, looks very Scandinavian, idling over a guitar, which she
   can't play, and she looks up at Norman and says:

   "We've all got hangups.. . and we've got to get rid of them." Yeah ...
   yeah ... I guess that's right. There ... on the other side here is a
   little figure with an enormous black beard. The little g-nome looks up at
   Norman. His eyes narrow and he breaks into a vast inexplicable grin,
   looking straight at Norman and then Engber, and then he goes scuttling out
   the door, snuffling and giggling to himself. Yeah .. . yeah ... I guess
   that's right, too. "I don't know what the hell has happened to me," says
   Engber, clutching his shoulder, "but it's getting worse."

   Norman keeps walking back through the house until he hits a bathroom. Only
   it is a madhouse of a bathroom. The walls, the ceilings, everything, one
   vast collage, lurid splashes of red and orange, lurid ads and lurid color
   photos from out of magazines, pieces of plastic, cloth, paper, streaks of
   Day-Glo paint, and from the ceiling and down one wall a wild diagonal romp
   of rhinoceroses, like a thousand tiny rhinoceroses chasing each other
   through Crazy Lurid Land. Over the top part of the mirror over the sink is
   a small death mask painted in Day-Glo. The mask hangs from a hinge. Norman
   lifts it up and underneath the mask is a typewritten message pasted on the
   mirror: "Now that I've got your attention ..."

   Norman and Engber go out back and head up the path that leads into the
   woods, to look for Kesey. Up past screaming Day-Glo tree trunks and tents
   here and there and some kind of weird cave down in a gully with Day-Glo
   objects glowing in the mouth of it and then into deep green glades under
   the redwoods with the lime light filtering through-and they keep coming
   upon weird objects. Suddenly, a whole bed, an old-fashioned iron bedstead,
   a mattress, a cover, but all glowing with mad stripes and swirls of
   orange, red, green yellow Day-Glo. Then a crazed toy horse in a tree
   trunk. Then a telephone-a telephone-sitting up on a tree stump, glowing in
   the greeny deeps with beautiful glowing cords of many colors coming out of
   it. Then a TV set, only with mad Day-Glo designs painted on the screen.
   Then into a clearing, a flash of sunlight, and down the slope, here comes
   Kesey. He looks twice as big as the time Norman saw him in L.A. He has on
   white Levi's and a white T-shirt. He walks very erect and his huge muscled
   arms swing loose. The redwoods soar all around.

   Norman says, "Hello-"

   But Kesey just nods slightly and smiles very faintly as if to say, You
   said you'd be here and here you are. Kesey looks around and then down the
   slope toward the tent plateaus and the house and the highway and says:

   "We're working on many levels here." -

   Engber clutches his shoulder and says:

   "I don't know what this thing is, Norman, but it's killing me. I've got to
   go back to L.A."

   "Well, O.K., Evan-"

   "I'll come back up when I get over it."

   Norman kind of knew he wouldn't, and he didn't, but Norman wanted to stick
   around.

   ALL RIGHT, FILM EDITOR, ARTICLE WRITER, PARTICIPANT-Observer, you're here.
   On with your ... editing writing observing. But somehow Norman doesn't
   start cutting film or writing his column. Almost immediately the strange
   atmosphere of the place starts rolling over him. There is an atmosphere
   of-how can one describe it?-we are all on to something here, or into
   something, but no one is going to put it into words for you. Put it into
   words-one trouble right away is that he finds it very hard to get into the
   conversations here in the house in the woods. Everyone is very friendly
   and most of them are outgoing. But they are all talking about-how can one
   describe it?-about. . . life, things that are happening around there,
   things they are doing-or about things of such an abstract and metaphorical
   nature that he can't fasten them, either. Then he realizes that what it
   really is is that they are interested in none of the common intellectual
   currency that makes up the conversations of intellectuals in Hip L.A., the
   standard topics, books, movies, new political movements-For years he and
   all his friends have been talking about nothing but intellectual products,
   ideas, concoctions, brain candy, shadows of life, as a substitute for
   living; yes. They don't even use the usual intellectual words here-mostly
   it is just thing.

   Cassady's thing is-christalmighty, Cassady-and it is with Cassady that he
   gets the first sense of the daily allegory at Kesey's, allegorical living,
   every action a demonstration of a lesson of life-like Cassady's Gestalt
   Driving-but that is your term ... Whenever there is any driving to be
   done, Cassady does it. That is Cassady's thing, or his thing on one level.
   They drive up the mountain, up to Skylonda, atop Cahill Ridge, for
   something. Coming back, down the mountain, Norman is in the back seat, two
   or three others are sitting front and back, and Cassady is driving. They
   start hauling down the mountain, faster and faster, the trees snapping by
   like in some kind of amusement park ride, only Cassady isn't looking at
   the road. Or holding onto the wheel. His right hand is flipping the dial
   on the radio. One rock 'n' roll number blips out here-I'm nurding ut noonh
   erlation-then another one here on the dial-vronnnh ba-bee suckpo
   pon-pon-all the time Cassady is whamming out the beat on the steering
   wheel with the heel of his left hand and the whole car seems to be
   shuddering with it-and his head is turned completely around looking Norman
   squarely in the eye and grinning as if he is having the most congenial
   delightful conversation with him, only Cassady is doing all the talking,
   an incredible oral fibrillation of words, nutty nostalgia-"a '46 Plymouth,
   you understand, gear shift like a Dairy Queen pulled up side a '47
   Chrysler jumpy little marshmallow fellow in there had a kickdown gear was
   gonna ossify the world, you understand"-all to Norman with the happiest
   smile in the world-

   You crazy fool-the truck-

   -at the last possible moment somehow Cassady fishtails the car back onto
   the inside of the curve and the truck shoots by clean black shot like a
   great 10-ton highballing tear drop of tar-Cassady still talking, hanging
   on the steering wheel, pounding and rapping away. Norman terrified; Norman
   looks at the others to see if-but they're all sitting there throughout the
   whole maniacal ride as if nothing out of the ordinary has happened at all.

   And maybe that's it-the first onset of Ahor paranoia hits-maybe that's it,
   maybe he has been sucked into some incredible trap by a bunch of
   dope-taking crazies who are going to toy with him, for what reason I do
   not-

   Back at the house he decides to get into his role of Journalist Reporter
   Observer. At least he will be doing something and be outside, sane,
   detached. He starts asking about this and that, about Cassady, about
   Babbs, about the ineffable things, about why-

   Mountain Girl explodes suddenly.

   "Why! Why! Why! Why! Why! Why! Why!" she says, throwing up her hands and
   shaking her head, with such an air of authority and conviction that he is
   crushed.

   Later Kesey comes in and happens to say in the course of
   something-"Cassady doesn't have to think any more"-then he walks away. It
   is as if for some reason he is furnishing Norman with part of the puzzle.

   Kesey keeps doing this kind of thing. As if by radar, Kesey materializes
   at the critical moment, in the cabin, out front, in the backhouse, up in
   the woods. The crisis may be somebody's personal thing or some group
   thing-suddenly Kesey pops up like Captain Shotover in Shaw's play
   Heartbreak House, delivers a line-usually something cryptic, allegorical,
   or merely descriptive, never a pronouncement or a judgment. Half the time
   he quotes the wisdom of some local sage-Page says, Cassady says, Babbs
   says-Babbs says, if you don't /(now what the next thing is, all you have
   to-and just as suddenly he's gone.

   For example-well, it always seems like there's no dissension around here,
   no arguments, no conflict, in spite of all these different and in some
   cases weird personalities ricocheting around and rapping and carrying on.
   Yet that is only an illusion. It is just that they don't have it out with
   one another. Instead, they take it to Kesey, all of them forever waiting
   for Kesey, circling around him.

   One kid, known as Pancho Pillow, was a ball-breaker freak. He has to break
   your balls by coming on obnoxious in any way he could dream up, after
   which you were supposed to reject him, after which he could feel hurt and
   blame you for... all. That was his movie. One night Pancho is in the house
   with a book about Oriental rugs, full of beautiful color plates, and he is
   rapping on and on about the beautiful rugs-

   "-like, man, I mean, these cats were turned on ten centuries ago, the
   whole thing, they had mandalas you never dreamed of-right?-look here, man,
   I want to blow your mind for you, just one time-"

   -and he sticks the book under some Prankster's nose-here's a beautiful
   color picture of an Isfahan rug, glowing reds and oranges and golds and
   starlike vibrating lines all radiating out from a medallion at the center-

   "No thanks, Pancho, I already had some."

   "Come on, man! I mean, like, I gotta share this thing, I gotta make you
   see it, I can't keep this whole thing to myself! Like, you know, I mean, I
   want to share it with you-you dig?-now you look at this one-"

   And so on, shoving the goddamn book at everybody, waiting for somebody to
   tell him to go fuck himself, at which point he can stalk out, fulfilled.

   Feed the hungry bee-but christ, this ball breaker is too much. So now all
   the Pranksters endure, waiting for one thing, waiting for Kesey to turn
   up. By and by the door opens and it's Kesey.

   "Hey man!" Pancho says and rushes up to him. "You gotta look at these
   things I found! I gotta turn you on to this, man! I mean, I really got to,
   because it will fucking blow your mind!" and he sticks the book in Kesey's
   face.

   Kesey just looks down at the picture of the Isfahan or the Shiraz or the
   Bakhtiari or whatever it is, as if he is studying it. And then he says,
   softly, in the Oregon drawl,

   "Why should I take your bad trip?"

   -without looking up, as if what he is saying has something to do with this
   diamond medallion here or this border of turtles and palms-

   "Bad trip!" Pancho screams. "What do you mean, bad trip!" and he throws
   the book to the floor, but Kesey is already off into the back of the
   house. And Pancho knows his whole thing is, in fact, not sharing beauty
   rugs at all, but simply his bad trip, and they all know that's what it's
   all about, and he \knows  they know it, and the whole game is over and so
   long, Pancho Pillow.

   AND YET IT BEGAN TO SEEM TO NORMAN THAT EVEN PANCHO was further into the
   group thing than he was. He felt useless. He never got to edit the movie.
   Kesey and Babbs would just say do some cutting. But he wanted to see the
   whole film first, a whole run-through, so he could see where it was going.
   It was the same with the group. He wanted to run the whole group back
   through his personal editing machine and see what the whole picture looked
   like and what the goal was. All the while it seemed like they were probing
   him, probing him, probing him for weaknesses. Bradley, of all people, blew
   up at him one morning, started calling him everything he could think of,
   apparently trying to stir him up. Norman was reading a Sanskrit textbook
   at the time, trying to learn the alphabet. He figured he might as well do
   that, since he wasn't doing anything else. He was also smoking a
   cigarette. Bradley starts in.

   "Every time you read a book or smoke a cigarette," he yells, "you're
   hitting me. Look at Pancho. Pancho's working. Pancho is writing poetry all
   the time, and every day he brings me a poem-"

   -which is ridiculous, Pancho's poems are so bad. In fact, it is so
   ridiculous Bradley breaks into a smile over it. Nevertheless, the point
   has been made. Which is that Norman is lazy, "personal." Reading is
   something that just gives pleasure to the reader. It is not for the group.
   Also smoking-a thing that begets nothing but itself. So he is telling
   Norman that he is lazy and not contributing. Which is true. He is right.
   But he wants to start a fight over it or something. This amuses Norman and
   he laughs at Bradley-Bradley-and yet even though it is only Bradley, it
   seems like an indication of how the rest feel. Otherwise Bradley probably
   never would have said anything. Norman becomes quieter and quieter, like a
   clam. And it seemed as if they laughed at him-

   "Not at you-with you," Kesey kept telling him, trying to josh him out of
   all his hangups and inferiorities.

   But the only thing that really helped was having Paul Foster turn up.

   Foster was a tall, curly-headed guy in his late twenties with a terrible
   stutter. He was a mathematician and had been working in Palo Alto as a
   computer programmer, making a lot of money, apparently. Then he started
   hanging out with some musicians and they turned him on to a few ...
   mind-expanders, and now Foster's life seemed to alternate between
   stretches of good straight computer programming, during which he wore a
   necktie and an iridescent teal-green suit of Zirconpolyesterethylene and
   was a formidable fellow in the straight world, and stretches of life with
   ... Speed, the Great God Rotor, during which he wore his Importancy Coat.
   This was a jacket he had turned into a collage. It had layers and layers
   of ribbons and slogan buttons and reflectors and Cracker Jack favors all
   over it, piled up and flapping in the breeze until it looked like a
   lunatic billowsleeve coat from out of the court of Louis XV. He moved into
   the tree. Sandy had built a house in the tree, a platform with a tent on
   it. Paul built one under it; O.K., a duplex tree house. Paul Foster came
   in with just an enormous amount of stuff, all this stuff. He brought it
   all in and he set up housekeeping in the tree. He put a window up in the
   tree, and a gate, and bookshelves. He had strange books. An encyclopedia,
   only it was an 1893 encyclopedia, and books on the strangest languages,
   Tagalog, Urdu, and apparently he knew something about all these languages
   ... and more and more stuff. He had a huge sack of googaws that he would
   carry around, of the weirdest stuff, bits of glittering glass and tin and
   transistor-radio shells, just the shells, and nails and screws and tops
   and tubes, and inside his sack of weird junk was a little sack that was a
   miniature of the big sack and contained tiny weird junk ... and you got
   the idea that somehow, somewhere in there was a very tiny little sack that
   contained very tiny weird junk, and that it went on that way into infinity
   ... He also had a lot of pens, some of them felt-nib pens with colors, and
   he sat up in the tree house while the old restless Roto-rooter, the good
   god Speed, scoured puns, puns, puns, puns, puns from out of the walls of
   his skull and he fashioned signs like one he put at the entrance of the
   place, where the driveway turned in to the bridge from Route 84, a sign
   reading: "No Left Turn Unstoned." Then people would come and he'd
   entertain them up in his tree house, and at night you would see it lit up
   like some mad thing, gleaming with Dali-Day-Glo swoops, and he would be up
   there drawing, drawing, drawing, drawing, or working on a huge mad
   scrapbook he had ...

   Norman and Paul Foster had a lot in common. They were both fairly good
   artists, they both had a certain fund of erudition erudition erudition.
   Foster, with his terrible stutter, valued privacy in the midst of it all,
   just as Norman did. Of course, Foster was proving himself a Prankster far
   faster than Norman was. It was a strange thing about that. There were no
   rules. There was no official period of probation, and no vote on is he or
   isn't he one of us, no blackballing, no tap on the shoulders. And yet
   there was a period of proving yourself, and everyone knew it was going on
   and no one ever said a word about it. In any case, Norman could talk to
   Foster, and that made all the difference. He didn't feel so desperately
   lonely any more. Also he suddenly saw that it wasn't just him-the
   Pranksters probed everybody, to make them bring their hangups out front to
   the point where they could act totally out front, live in the moment,
   spontaneously, and if needling was what it took to bring you that far-

   Foster is coming on, in the house, with these wild logical conundrums he
   had, only stuttering something awful:

   -Sup-puh-puh-puh-pose that that everything you per-per-per-perceive is
   only a . . ."-some long involved thing, and Mountain Girl breaks in:

   -B-b-b-b-b-but, P-P-P-P-P-P-Paul, I don't git the p-p-p-p-p-point about
   all this per-per-per-per-per-per-ception. I try to git it,
   b-b-b-b-b-b-b-but all I git is the w-w-w-w-w-w-words. How 'bout goin' over
   it ag-gih-gih-gih-gih-gih-gih-gih-gih-gih-gih-gih-gih-gih -gih-gihn!"

   Foster can't believe this performance. He stands there frozen with his
   eyes bugging out, bugging out, bugging out, bugging out bigger and bigger
   until he explodes:

   "Is that supposed to be funny! You've got a worse hangup than stuttering,
   Mountain Girl ! You've got a fat mouth and you don't know what to use it
   for! Ugly-that's your trip, the ugly trip! Well, all I know is-"

   "Yuh see!" Mountain Girl says. She is grinning, triumphant practically
   laughing and clapping her hands, she is so pleased with the results. "When
   you git mad, you don't stutter!"

   Foster freezes again. He stares at her. Then he wheels around and walks
   out the door without saying another word.

   The funny part is, she's right

   .

   WHAT WAS IT? ... IT WAS LIKE . . . WELL, YES! GROUP THERAPY, like a
   marathon encounter in group therapy, in which everybody is together for
   days, probing everybody's weaknesses, bringing everything out front. Only
   this was group therapy not for the middle-aged and fucked-up but for the
   Young! and Immune!-as if they were not patching up wrecks but tooling up
   the living for some incredible breakthrough, beyond catastrophe. Since
   time was, the serious concerns of man have always been fights against
   catastrophe, against sickness, war, poverty, enslavement, always the
   horsemen of the Apocalypse riding. But what to do in that scary void
   beyond catastrophe, where all, supposedly, will be possible-and Norman
   happens upon another of those strange, prophetic books on Kesey's shelf,
   Arthur Clarke's Childhood's End, in which . .. the Total Breakthrough
   generation is born on Earth and as mere infants they show powers of mind
   far beyond their parents' and they go off into a colony by themselves, not
   as individuals, however, but as one great colonial being, in the
   biological sense of the colonial animal, until, at last, the Earth, its
   mission complete, convulses, starts coming apart, and they, the children:
   "Something's starting to happen. The stars are becoming dimmer. It's as if
   a great cloud is coming up, very swiftly, all over over all the sky. But
   it isn't really a cloud. It seems to have some sort of structure-I can
   glimpse a hazy network of lines and bands that keep changing their
   position. It's almost as if the stars are tangled in a ghostly spider's
   web. The whole network is beginning to glow, to pulse with light, exactly
   as if it were alive . . . There's a great burning column, like a tree of
   fire, reaching above the western horizon. It's a long way off right around
   the world. I know where it springs from: they're on their way at last, to
   become part of the Overmind. Their probation is ended: they're leaving the
   last remnants of matter behind ... The whole landscape is lit up-it's
   brighter than day-reds and golds and greens are chasing each other across
   the sky-oh, it's beyond words, it doesn't seem fair that I'm the only one
   to see it-I never thought such colors-"

   In short, zonked out of their ever-loving gourds, man, and heading out
   toward... Edge City, absolutely, and we're truly synched tonight.

   -but no water spouts of Academie Franc,aise cherubim and water babies
   here, and no reverent toga-linen-flapping Gautama Buddha Orientals
   breathing out the spent Roquefort breath of spiritual detachment. Instead,
   somehow they're going to try it right down the main highway, eight lanes
   wide, heron-neck arc lamps rising up as far as the eye can see, and they
   will broadcast on all frequencies, waving American flags, turning up the
   Day-Glo and the neon of 1960s electro-pastel America, wired up and
   amplified, 327,000 horsepower, a fantasy bus in a science-fiction movie,
   welcoming all on board, no matter how unbelievably Truck Stop Low Rent or
   raunchy-

                                    chapter

                                      XIII

                               The Hell's Angels

   I DOUBT IF ANY OF THE PRANKSTERS TRULY UNDERSTOOD Mountain Girl, except
   for Kesey. Most of the time she was so 100 percent out front, coming on
   loud and clear and candid as a Mack truck, it never occurred to anybody
   that a whole side of her was hidden. Except for Kesey, as I say. Sometimes
   Kesey and Mountain Girl would disappear into the backhouse and lie on
   mattresses and just talk, Kesey rapping on about how he felt about all
   sorts of things, life, fate, Now-while Mountain Girl-one thought of hers
   making sorties through the soft word flow coming from Kesey on the
   mattress there-yes, well, and she told Kesey as frankly as she could about
   the last four or five years of her life. Kesey didn't understand
   completely. Namely, she was sometimes lonely as hell.

   Lonely? Why, for chrissake, Mountain Girl came swinging into every
   situation like on a vine, like Sheena, Queen of the Jungle. She was high
   in the Prankster hierarchy already. Nobody was closer to Kesey than
   Mountain Girl, not even Faye, it often seemed. But there it was: Kesey ..
   . Kesey was essential to Mountain Girl's whole life with the Pranksters.
   Without him, and Hassler, a weird loneliness could take over ... Hassler
   was the only other person she could talk to. Without Hassler- But it can
   be tense underneath in a commune, beautiful on one level, but you have to
   be willing to force it a little to keep it that way.

   It is really funny. This afternoon the sprinklers are ratcheting away all
   sprinkly and starchy on the lawns of Poughkeepsie. In August the sun
   causes such brown spots where the trees don't shade it, you understand.
   Well, freak that. The solution, Doctor, happens to be named Kesey. This
   sound now, Doctor, rising above the ratcheting, would probably throw your
   poor little thready heart into fibrillation. It's like a locomotive coming
   through the redwood trees around the bends down Route 84 from Skylonda.
   The Hell's Angels in running formation, to be exact, scores of the
   monsters, on Harley-Davidson 74s. Miss Carolyn Adams of Poughkeepsie,
   N.Y., is about to look this primordial menace in the face and bark
   bullshit commands at the Hell's Angels, which they obey, since the
   sunspots exploding in their eyes bedazzle the monsters. The energy flows
   from Kesey, Doctor, and there is not one goddamn thing to git your little
   heart scared of.

   KESEY MET THE HELL's ANGELS ONE AFTERNOON IN SAN Francisco through Hunter
   Thompson, who was writing a book about them. It turned out to be a
   remarkable book, as a matter of fact, called Hell's Angels, a Strange and
   Terrible Saga. Anyway, Kesey and Thompson were having a few beers and
   Thompson said he had to go over to a garage called the Box Shop to see a
   few of the Angels, and Kesey went along. A Hell's Angel named Frenchy and
   four or five others were over there working on their motorcycles and they
   took to Kesey right away. Kesey was a stud who was just as tough as they
   were. He had just been busted for marijuana, which certified him as Good
   People in the Angels' eyes. They told him you can't trust a man who hasn't
   done time, and Kesey was on the way to doing time, in any case. Kesey said
   later that the marijuana bust impressed them but they couldn't have cared
   less that he was a novelist. But they knew about that, too, and here was a
   big name who was friendly and interested in them, even though he wasn't a
   queer or a reporter or any of those other creep suck-ups who were coming
   around that summer.

   And a great many were coming around in the summer of 1965. The summer of
   1965 had made the Hell's Angels infamous celebrities in California. Their
   reputation was at its absolutely most notorious all-time highest. A series
   of incidents-followed by an amazing series of newspaper and magazine
   articles, Life and the Saturday Evening Post among them-had the people of
   the Far West looking to each weekend in the Angels' life as an invasion by
   baby-raping Huns. Intellectuals around San Francisco, particularly at
   Berkeley, at the University of California, were beginning to romanticize
   about the Angels in terms of "alienation" and "a generation in revolt,"
   that kind of thing. People were beginning to get in touch with Thompson to
   see if he couldn't arrange for them to meet the Angels-not the whole
   bunch, Hunter, maybe one or two at a time. Well, Kesey didn't need any one
   or two at a time. He and the boys took a few tokes on a joint, and the
   Hell's Angels were on the bus.

   The next thing the citizens of La Honda knew, there was a huge sign at the
   Kesey place-15 feet long, three feet high, in red white and blue.

                              The Merry Pranksters

                           Welcome the Hell's Angels

   Saturday, August 7, 1965, was a bright clear radiant limelit summer day
   amid God's handiwork in La Honda, California. The citizens were getting
   ready for the day by nailing shut their doors. The cops were getting ready
   by revving up a squad of ten patrol cars with flashing lights and
   ammunition. The Pranksters were getting ready by getting bombed. They were
   down there in the greeny gorge, in the cabin and around it, under the
   redwoods, getting bombed out of their gourds. They had some good heavy
   surges of God-given adrenaline going for them, too. Nobody ever came right
   out front and said it, but this happened to be the real-life Hell's Angels
   coming, about forty of them, on a full-fledged Angels' "run," the sort of
   outing on which the Angels did their thing, their whole freaking thing, en
   mangy raunchy head-breaking fire-pissing rough-goddamn-housing masse. The
   Pranksters had a lot of company for the occasion. It was practically like
   an audience, all waiting for the stars to appear. A lot of the old Perry
   Lane crowd was there, Vic Lovell, Ed McClanahan, and the others. Allen
   Ginsberg was there and so was Richard Alpert and a lot of San Francisco
   and Berkeley intellectuals. Tachycardia, you all-but Kesey was calm and
   even laughing a little, looking strong as an ox in his buckskin shirt, the
   Mountain Man, and he made it all seem right and inevitable, an inevitable
   part of the flow and right now in this moment. Hell, if the straight world
   of San Mateo County, California, had decided to declare them all outlaws
   over an innocuous thing like marijuana, then they could freaking well go
   with the flow and show them what the saga called Outlaw was really like.
   The Angels brought a lot of things into synch. Outlaws, by definition,
   were people who had moved off of dead center and were out in some kind of
   Edge City. The beauty of it was, the Angels had done it like the
   Pranksters, by choice. They had become outlaws first- to explore,
   muvva-and then got busted for it. The Angels' trip was the motorcycle and
   the Pranksters' was LSD, but both were in an incredible entry into an
   orgasmic moment, now, and within forty-eight hours the Angels would be
   taking acid on board, too. The Pranksters would be taking on . .. Ahor,
   the ancient horror, the middle-class boy fear of Hell's Angels. Hell's
   Angels, in the dirty flesh, and if they could bring that dark deep-down
   thing into their orbit-

   Kesey ! What in the freaking-tachycardia, you all...

   Bob Dylan's voice is raunching and rheuming in the old jack-legged chants
   in huge volume from out the speakers up in the redwood tops up on the dirt
   cliff across the highway-He-e-e-ey Mis-ter Tam-bou-rine Man-as part of
   Sandy Lehmann-Haupt's Non-Station KLSD program, the indomitable
   disco-freak-jockey Lord Byron Styrofoam himself, Sandy, broadcasting over
   a microphone in a cabin and spinning them for you-Cassady revved up so
   tight it's like mechanical speed man sprocket-Mountain Girl ready-Hey,
   Kesey!-Hermit grin- Page ablaze-men, women, children, painted and in
   costume- ricochet around the limelit dell-Argggggghhhhh-about 3 p.m. they
   started hearing it.

   It was like a locomotive about ten miles away. It was the Hell's Angels in
   "running formation" coming over the mountain on Harley-Davidson 74s. The
   Angels were up there somewhere weaving down the curves on Route 84,
   gearing down- thragggggggggh-and winding up, and the locomotive sound got
   louder and louder until you couldn't hear yourself talk any more or Bob
   Dylan rheumy and-thraaaaaaaggggghhh-here they came around the last curve,
   the Hell's Angels, with the bikes, the beards, the long hair, the
   sleeveless denim jackets with the death's head insignia and all the rest,
   looking their most royal rotten, and then one by one they came barreling
   in over the wooden bridge up to the front of the house, skidding to a stop
   in explosions of dust, and it was like a movie or something-each one of
   the outlaws bouncing and gunning across the bridge with his arms spread
   out in a tough curve to the handlebars and then skidding to a stop, one
   after another after another.

   The Angels, for their part, didn't know what to expect. Nobody had ever
   invited them anywhere before, at least not as a gang. They weren't on many
   people's invitation lists. They figured they would see what was there and
   what it was all about, and they would probably get in a hell of a fight
   before it was all over, and heads would break, but that was about par for
   the course anyway. The Angels always came into alien situations black and
   wary, sniffing out the adversary, but that didn't even register at this
   place. So many people were already so high, on something, it practically
   dissolved you on the spot. The Pranksters had what looked like about a
   million doses of the Angels' favorite drug-beer-and LSD for all who wanted
   to try it. The beer made the Angels very happy and the LSD made them
   strangely peaceful and sometimes catatonic, in contrast to the Pranksters
   and other intellectuals around, who soared on the stuff.

   June the Goon gave a Hell's Angel named Freewheeling Frank some LSD, which
   he thought was some kind of souped-up speed or something-and he had the
   most wondrous experience of his life. By nightfall he had climbed a
   redwood and was nestled up against a loudspeaker in a tree grooving off
   the sounds and vibrations of Bob Dylan singing "The Subterranean Homesick
   Blues."

   Pete, the drag racer, from the San Francisco Hell's Angels, grinned and
   rummaged through a beer tub and said, "Man, this is nothing but a goddamn
   wonderful scene. We didn't know what to expect when we came, but it turned
   out just fine. This time it's all ha-ha, not thump-thump." Soon the gorge
   was booming with the Angels' distinctive good-time lots-a-beer belly
   laugh, which goes: Haw!-Haw!-Haw!-Haw!-Haw!- Haw!

   Sandy Lehmann-Haupt, Lord Byron Styrofoam, had hold of the microphone and
   his disco-freak-jockey rapping blared out of the redwoods and back across
   the highway: "This is Non-Station KLSD, 800 micrograms in your head, the
   station designed to blow your mind and undo your bind, from up here atop
   the redwoods on Venus!" Then he went into a long talking blues song about
   the Hell's Angels, about fifty stanzas worth, some of it obscure acid
   talk, some of it wild legends, about squashing turtles on the highway,
   nutty stuff like that, and every stanza ending with the refrain:

                       Oh, but it's great to be an Angel,

                           And be dirty all the time!

   What the hell-here was some wild-looking kid with the temerity to
   broadcast out over the highways of California that Angels | were dirty all
   the time-but how the hell could you resist, it was too freaking madly
   manic-and pretty soon the Angels and everybody else were joining in the
   chorus:

                       Oh, but it's great to be an Angel,

                           And be dirty all the time!

   Then Allen Ginsberg was in front of the microphone with finger cymbals on
   each hand, dancing around with a beard down to his belly and chanting
   Hindu chants into the microphone booming out over California, U.S.A., Hare
   Krishna hare Krishna hare Krishna hare krishna-what the mollyfock is hairy
   krishna-who is this hairy freak-but you can't help yourself, you got to
   groove with this cat in spite of yourself. Ginsberg really bowled the
   Angels over. He was a lot of things the Angels hated, a Jew, an
   intellectual, a New Yorker, but he was too much, the greatest straightest
   unstraight guy they ever met.

                           And be dirty all the time!

   The filthy kooks-by nightfall the cops were lined up along the highway,
   car after car, just across the creek, outside the gate, wondering what the
   fock. The scene was really getting weird. The Pranksters had everything in
   their electronic arsenal going, rock 'n' roll blazing through the
   treetops, light projections streaming through the gorge, Station KLSD
   blazing and screaming over the cops' heads, people in Day-Glo regalia
   blazing and lurching in the gloom, the Angels going Haw-Haw-Haw- Haw,
   Cassady down to just his hell of a build, nothing else, just his hell of a
   build, jerking his arms out and sprocketing around under a spotlight on
   the porch of the log manse, flailing a beer bottle around in one hand and
   shaking his other one at the cops:

   "You sneaky motherfuckers! What the fuck's wrong with you! Come on over
   here and see what you get... goddamn your shit-filled souls
   anyway!"-laughing and jerking and sprocketing-"Don't fuck with me, you
   sons of shit-lovers. Come on over. You'll get every fucking thing you
   deserve."

   The hell of it, men, is here is a huge obscene clot of degradation,
   depradation and derogation proceeding loose and crazed on the hoof before
   our very eyes, complete with the very Hell's Angels, and there is nothing
   we can do but contain it. Technically, they might have been able to move
   in on the grounds of Cassady's exposing himself or something of the sort,
   but no real laws were being broken, except every law of God and man-but
   sheer containment was looking like the best policy. Moving in on those
   crazies even with ten carloads of armed cops for a misdemeanor like lewd
   display-the explosion was too grotesque to think of. And the cops' turret
   lights revolved and splashed against the dirt cliff in a red strobe light
   effect and their car-to-headquarters radios were wide open and cracking
   out with sulphurous 220-volt electric thorn baritones and staticky
   sibilants-He-e-e-ey Mis-ter Tam-bou-rine Man-just to render the La Honda
   gorge totally delirious.

   Meanwhile, the Angels were discovering the goddamnedest thing. Usually,
   most places they headed into on their runs, they tested people's cool.
   What are you looking at, mother. As soon as the shock or naked terror
   registered, they would be happy. Or if there was no shock and terror but
   instead somebody tried some brave little shove back, then it was time to
   break heads and tear everybody a new asshole. But these mollyfocking
   Pranksters were test-proof. The Angels didn't know what permissive was
   until they got to Kesey's. Go with the flow! The biggest baddest toughest
   most awfulest-looking Hell's Angel of them all was a big monster named
   Tiny. The second biggest baddest toughest most-awfulest-looking Hell's
   Angel was a big raw-boned guy named Buzzard, dark-looking, with all this
   dark hair and a beard, all shaggy and matted and his nose came out like a
   beak and his Adam's apple hung down about a foot, and he was just like an
   enormous buzzard. Tiny and Buzzard had a thing of coming up to each other
   when they were around non-Angels and sticking out their tongues and then
   licking each other's tongues, a big sloppy lap it up, just to shake up the
   squares, it really jolted them-so they came up right in front of this tall
   broad of Kesey's, Mountain Girl, and la-a-a-a-a-ap-and they couldn't
   believe it. She just looked right at them and grinned and exploded
   sunballs out of her eyes and started laughing at them, Haw-Haw-Haw, as if
   to say in plain language: What a bullshit thing. It was freaking
   incredible. Then some of them passed a joint around and they passed it to
   Mountain Girl and she boomed out:

   "Hell, no! What the hell you doing putting your dirty mouth on this clean
   joint for! This is a clean joint and you're putting your dirty mouths on
   it!" Nobody in living memory had ever refused a toke from a joint passed
   by Angels, at least not on grounds of sanitation, except this crazy girl
   who was just bullshitting them blind, and they loved it.

   It even got to the point where Mountain Girl saw Tiny heading into the mad
   bathroom with a couple of beer cans like he is going to hole up in there
   and drink a couple of cans in peace, but this is the bathroom all the
   girls around here are using, and Mountain Girl yells out to Sonny Barger,
   the maximum leader of the Hell's Angels, "Hey, Sonny! Tell this big piece
   of trash to stay out of our clean bathroom!"-in a bullshit tone, of
   course-and Sonny picks it up, "Yeah, you big piece of trash! Stay out of
   the clean bathroom! They don't want you in there!"-and Tiny slinks out the
   door, outside, in a bullshit slink, but he does it-

   And that's it! It's happening. The Hell's Angels are in our movie, we've
   got 'em in. Mountain Girl and a lot of the Pranksters had hit on the
   perfect combination with the Angels. They were friendly toward them, maybe
   friendlier than anybody had been in their lives, but they weren't craven
   about it, and they took no shit. It was the perfect combination, but the
   Pranksters didn't even have to think of it as a combination. They just did
   their thing and that was the way it worked out. All these principles they
   had been working on and talking about in the isolation of La Honda-they
   freaking well worked.

   Go with the flow-and what a flow-these cats, these Pranksters-at big routs
   like this the Angels often had a second feature going entitled Who Gets
   Fucked?-and it hadn't even gotten to that before some blonde from out of
   town, one of the guests from way out there, just one nice soft honey
   hormone squash, she made it clear to three Angels that she was ready to
   go, so they all trooped out to the backhouse and they had a happy round
   out there. Pretty soon all the Angels knew about the "new mamma" out in
   the backhouse and a lot of them piled in there, hooking down beers,
   laughing, taking their turns, making various critiques. The girl had her
   red and white dress pushed up around her chest, and two or three would be
   on her at once, between her legs, sitting on her face in the sick ochre
   light of the shack with much lapping and leering and bubbling and gulping
   through furzes of pubic hair while sweat and semen glistened on the
   highlights of her belly and thighs and she twitched and moaned, not in
   protest, however, in a kind of drunken bout of God knew what and men with
   no pants on were standing around, cheering, chiding, waiting for their
   turn, or their second turn, or the third until she had been fenestrated in
   various places at least fifty times. Some of the Angels went out and got
   her ex-husband. He was weaving and veering around, bombed, they led him in
   there under glare and leer and lust musk suffocate the rut hut they told
   him to go to it. All silent-shit, this is going too far-but the girl rises
   up in a blear and asks him to kiss her, which he does, glistening
   secretions, then he lurches and mounts her and slides it in, and the
   Angels cheer Haw Haw-

   -but that is her movie, it truly is, and we have gone with the flow.

   So much beer-which is like an exotic binge for the Pranksters, beer.
   Mountain Girl and Kesey are up in the limelit bower and the full moon
   comes down through the treetop silhouettes. They are just rapping in the
   moonlight, and then Sandy wanders on up there and sits with them, high on
   acid, and he looks down and the floor of the forest is rippling with
   moonlight, the ground shimmers and rolls like a stream in the magic bower
   and they just sit there-a buzzard! Buzzard is wandering up the slope
   toward them and there in the moonlight in the dark in the magic bower
   he... is a buzzard, the biggest ever made, the beak, the deathly black,
   the dopply glottal neck, the shelled back and dangling wings, stringy
   nodule legs-Kaaawwwwwww!-and Kesey jumps up and starts throwing his arms
   up at him, like the way you would scare away a buzzard, and says,

   "Aaaaagh! a buzzard! Hey! Get away, you're a buzzard! Get this buzzard out
   of here!"

   It's a bullshit gesture, of course-and Buzzard laughs-Haw! Haw! Haw!-it is
   not real, but it is... real, real buzzard, you can see the whole thing
   with two minds-Kaw Kaw Kaaawwwww-and Buzzard jumps and flaps his arms-and
   the whole ... connection, the synch, between the name, the man, the bird,
   flows together right there, and it doesn't matter whether he is buzzard or
   man because it has all come together, and they all see it...

   They all see so much. Buzzard goes, and Sandy goes, and Kesey and Mountain
   Girl are in the moonlight ripply bower. By and by-where?-Kesey and
   Mountain Girl-and so much flows together from the lights and the delirium
   and the staticky sibilants down below, so much is clear, so much flows in
   Tightness, that night, under the full moon, up above the flails and
   bellows down below-

                                     * * *

   THE HELL'S ANGELS PARTY WENT ON FOR TWO DAYS AND THE cops never moved in.
   Everybody, Angels and Pranksters, had a righteous time and no heads were
   broken. There had been one gang-bang, but the girl was a volunteer. It was
   her movie. In fact, for the next six or seven weeks, it was one long party
   with the Angels. The news spread around intellectual-hip circles in the
   San Francisco-Berkeley area like a legend. In these circles, anyway, it
   once and for all put Kesey and the Pranksters up above the category of
   just another weirdo intellectual group. They had broken through the worst
   hangup that intellectuals know-the real-life hangup. Intellectuals were
   always hung up with the feeling that they weren't coming to grips with
   real life. Real life belonged to all those funky spades and prize fighters
   and bullfighters and dock workers and grape pickers and wetbacks.
   Nostalgie de la boue. Well, the Hell's Angels were real life. It didn't
   get any realer than that, and Kesey had pulled it off. People from San
   Francisco and Berkeley started coming by La Honda more than ever. It was
   practically like an intellectual tourist attraction. Kesey would talk
   about the Angels.

   "I asked Sonny Barger how he picks new members, new Angels, and he told
   me, 'We don't pick 'em. We recognize 'em.' "

   And everybody grokked over that.

   Likely as not, people would find Hell's Angels on the place. The Angels
   were adding LSD to the already elaborate list of highs and lows they
   liked, beer, wine, marijuana, benzedrine, Seconal, Amytal, Nembutal,
   Tuinal. Some of them had terrible bummers-bummer was the Angels' term for
   a bad trip on a motorcycle and very quickly it became the hip world's term
   for a bad trip on LSD. The only bad moment at Kesey's came one day when an
   Angel went berserk during the first rush of the drug and tried to strangle
   his old lady on Kesey's front steps. But he was too wasted at that point
   to really do much.

   So it was wonderful and marvelous, an unholy alliance, the Merry
   Pranksters and the Hell's Angels, and all hours of the day or night you
   could hear the Hell's Angels gearing and winding down Route 84 to Kesey's,
   and the people of La Honda felt like the plague had come, and wasn't there
   anything that could be done. More than one of the Pranksters had his
   reservations, too. The Angels were like a time bomb. So far, so good-one
   day the Angels even swept and cleaned up the place-but they were capable
   of busting loose into carnage at any moment. It brought the adrenaline
   into your throat. The potential was there, too, because if the truth were
   known, there were just a few of the Pranksters who could really talk to
   the Angels-chiefly Kesey and Mountain Girl. Mainly it was Kesey. Kesey was
   the magnet and the strength, the man in both worlds. The Angels respected
   him and they weren't about to screw him around. He was one of the coolest
   guys they had ever come across. One day, finally, Kesey's cool came to the
   test with the Angels and it was a strange moment.

   Kesey and the Pranksters and the Angels had taken to going out to the
   backhouse and sitting in a big circle and doing the Prankster thing, a lot
   of rapping back and forth and singing, high on grass, and you never knew
   where it was going to go. Usually it went great. The Angels took to the
   Prankster thing right away. They seemed to have an immediate intuitive
   grasp of where it was going, and one time Kesey started playing a regular
   guitar and Babbs started playing a four-string amplified guitar and Kesey
   got into a song, off the top of his head, about "the vibrations," a bluesy
   song, and the Angels joined in, and it got downright religious in there
   for a while, with everybody singing, "Oh, the vi-bra-tions ... Oh, the
   vi-bra-tions .. ."

   And then Kesey and a few of the Pranksters and a lot of the Angels,
   including Sonny Barger of the Oakland Chapter, the maximum leader of all
   the Angels, were sitting around in the backhouse passing around joints and
   rapping. The subject was "people who are bullshit."

   There are certain people who are bullshit and you can always recognize
   them, Kesey was saying, and the Angels were nodding yeah, that certainly
   is right.

   "Now you take-," said Kesey, mentioning one of the Angels who was not
   present. "He's a bullshit person."

   A bullshit person-and man-

   "Listen, Kesey," says Barger, 100 percent Hell's Angel, "-is an Angel, and
   nobody-nobody-calls an Angel a bullshit person."

   -the freaking gauntlet is down. It's like forever and every eye in the
   place pins on Kesey's face and you can hear the blood squirt in your
   veins. But Kesey doesn't even blink and his voice doesn't even change one
   halftone, just the old Oregon drawl:

   "But I know him, Sonny. If I didn't know him, I wouldn't call him a
   bullshit person."

   Yeah-we-e-e-elll-everybody, Angels and Pranksters- well-Kesey knows
   him-there is nothing to do but grok over this statement, and everybody
   sits there, still, trying to grok over it, and after a second, the moment
   where heads get broken and fire gets pissed is over-We-e-ell, ye-ah-

   Two or three days later it occurs to some of the Pranksters that they
   still don't know what the hell Kesey meant when he said that. He knows the
   guy. It doesn't make any sense. It's a concept with no bottom to it-but so
   what! At the moment he said it, it was the one perfect thing he could have
   said. Kesey was so totally into the moment, he could come up with it, he
   could break up that old historic push me, shove you, yeah-sez-who sequence
   and in an instant the moment, that badass moment, was over.

   THE PRANKSTERS GOT PRETTY CLOSE TO SEVERAL OF THE Angels as individuals.
   Particularly Gut and Freewheeling Frank and Terry the Tramp. Every now and
   then somebody would take one or another of the Angels up into the tree
   house and give them a real initiation into psychedelics. They had a huge
   supply of DMT. As somebody once put it, LSD is a long strange journey; DMT
   is like being shot out of a cannon. There in the tree house, amid the
   winking googaws, they would give the Angels DMT, and Mountain Girl saw
   some of them, like Freewheeling Frank, after they came down. They would
   walk around in no particular direction, listing slightly, the eyes bugged
   wide open, glazed.

   "They were as naked as an Angel is ever gonna git," she told Kesey.

   Dear Lord, prepare to blast off

   Oh, the vi-bra-tions ...

   Among those who began to wonder about the mysteries of La Honda

   Were some Unitarian ministers known as the Young Turks;

   Bob Kimball, Dick Weston and Paul Sawyer said freak our cerebral cloisters
   and

   Emerge! See how the alleged grass-smoking Kesey's magic works.

   The Young Turks saw Unitarians becoming ghostly seminarians,

   Desiccated Kantians cut off from Early Christianity.

   Oh, a century ago we were the vangard, routing the redneck blackguards

   Of Fundamentalism-and today?-the Youth yawn at our inanity.

   Oh, the vi-bra-tions...

   Oh, the Unitarians...

   Apostate seminarians...

   Grok the groovy

   Pranksters and Hell's Angels...

   Whose Angels?-

   Sawyer found our Day-Glo heroes on the beach at Pescadero

   One sunny afternoon with Allen Ginsberg in his finest bearded form.

   The scene was charged with energy, yet there was a weird serenity

   Even when the Hell's Angels pulled in, ran\ but most righteously warm.

   Now, Sawyer had his teenage daughter along and she feared something
   might... go wrong.

   When Kesey said, On the bus! she said, "Daddy, I... don't want to go."

   So his daughter stayed behind, but Sawyer was determined to find

   The secret of this vibrant communion: Angel Black & Prankster Day-Glo.

   Oh, the vi-bra-tions. ..

   Oh, the Unitarians...

   Apostate seminarians ...

   Grok the groovy

   Pranksters and Hell's Angels ...

   Whose Angels?-

   Onto the bus! and it was so fine, with Angels hooking down great jugs of
   wine

   And grooving on the sunlit ocean like euphoric Nature freaks,

   Passing joints and Haw!-Haw!-Hawing! but coursing through their raucous
   bawling-

   A precognitive Early Churchly Gnostic note: Ecstatic Peace!

   Kesey knows precisely what he's about! No motorcycle beatnik rout

   But a trip more vital than all the Kantian prattle in the world.

   He has reached the unreachable! Taught and learned from the unteachable!

   The Young Turks owed it to the Church to give the Prankster trip a whirl.

   Oh, the vi-bra-tions...

   Oh, the Unitarians ...

   Apostate seminarians...

   Grok the groovy

   Pranksters and Hell's Angels...

   So Kesey was invited to come take part in the annual California Unitarian
   Church conference at Asilomar, beautiful state park by the sea in
   Monterey. The theme this year was: "Shaking the Foundations."

   The fact that Kesey had lately been arrested on a narcotics charge
   couldn't have mattered less to the Unitarians assembled on the greeny
   glades of Asilomar by the sea, not even the older ones. The Unitarians had
   a long tradition of liberalism in such matters and, in fact, were in the
   vanguard of the civil-rights movement in California. There was a good deal
   of civil disobedience and scrapes with the police in that fight; yes, sir.
   But this ...

   ... this...  The Unitarians were assembled there in Intellectual Sport
   Shirt multitudes-intellectuals Roughing-it, you understand, in
   short-sleeved sport shirts and casual Stretcheez trousers with roomy
   bottoms and waists up about the rib cage, drawing, casually, on pipes. And
   here came Kesey. But not alone, it so happened. He arrived on the bus, in
   a blur of Day-Glo swirls, with Pranksters in costume flapping out of every
   portal. Among the middle-aged Unitarians, ministers and laymen, tamping
   down their pipes for a nice relaxed Sport Shirt week, there was
   consternation written on practically every face as they watched the
   bizarre vehicle pitching and rolling into the camp grounds. Things were
   ... up tight from the moment they got there.

   I guess this is kind of rubbing their noses in it, thought Kesey. The
   Unitarians are people who stand up for the right to dissent and
   nonconformity and a lot of other good things, and we're rubbing their
   noses in it-a bunch of dope fiends, a couple of ex-convicts, one
   homosexual, men and women living on a bus .. .

   But the Unitarian ... Youth, the teenagers weren't up tight at all. They
   flocked around the bus as soon as it got there. Which only wound their
   parents up tighter, of course. By nightfall the Unitarian Church in
   California was divided into two camps: on the bus and off the bus.

   Kesey's very first appearance on the rostrum got three-fourths of the
   Sport Shirts so up tight, the conference was ready to fly apart. The main
   programs were held in a rustic summer-theater-type building on the camp
   grounds. Kesey appeared at the rostrum in a glowing Yin-Yang jacket. It
   was an iridescent jacket with a huge Yin-Yang symbol painted on the back
   in red, white, and blue.

   "We're going to be here seven days," said Kesey, "so we're going to try to
   work a miracle in seven days-"

   -and not by talking about it, bub, but by doing it, all of us together,
   and not by me talking at you, either, but by all of us doing our thing out
   front and wailing with it.

   Many of the women at the conference began to look, rapt, at this rugged,
   virile man of action who now manned the pulpit. The Sports Shirts did not
   fail to take note of that rapt gleam on their chops, either.

   Paul Sawyer, in the front row, was aware of the tension building up; but
   so far, all to the good. "Shake the Foundations" was the name of the
   conference, and so let it be. Sawyer was sitting next to Mountain Girl.
   What an amazing creature!-sitting next to him here in a vast purple robe.
   By a remarkable coincidence-coincidence?-she had been brought up as a
   Unitarian herself and had been a member of the real hope of the church,
   the LRY, the Liberal Religious Youth. And now-but had she really strayed
   far from what the LRY ought to be? It was debatable ...

   Onstage, Kesey, not talking in any formal way, more like performing,
   working magic-telling of the kind of symbols we use and the games we're
   in, and how you can't really know what an emotion is until you've
   experienced both sides of it, whereupon he seizes the big American flag up
   on the stage and steps on it, grinds it into the floor-

   -huge gasp from the crowd, many of whom are teenagers-

   Sawyer is already into the thing, and he sees what Kesey is trying to
   do-don't just describe an emotion, but arouse it, make them experience it,
   by manipulating the symbol of the emotion, and sometimes we have to come
   into awareness through the back door. Sawyer hears sobs, wheels around in
   his seat, sees a group of teenagers behind him, from Salt Lake City, looks
   into their faces, reads the horror that fills them-The Flag!-then feels
   the manic energy from the crazed thing that has been packed into these
   children even at this age like a time warp vibration from the Salem witch
   hysteria, the primordial cry of Die, Infidel-and yet he can't leave them
   with that. So he rises up and faces the crowd and says,

   -Now wait a minute. That flag is a symbol we attach our emotions to, but
   it isn't the emotion itself and it isn't the thing we really care about.
   Sometimes we don't even realize what we really care about, because we get
   so distracted by the symbols. I remember when I was at school, we used to
   sing America the Beautiful and somebody would walk down the aisle carrying
   the flag. I always wanted to be the one who carried the flag down the
   aisle but I never was. Now, what was I really feeling? Patriotism? Or was
   it-

   But he doesn't get to finish. A voice cries: "Do it!"

   -what?

   "Do it!" It's Mountain Girl, beaming at him from her folds of purple,
   quite delighted with the turn of events.

   Before he knows it, he is leading them all in the singing of America the
   Beautiful, and O beau-ti-ful for spa-cious skies rings out in the hall-as
   he holds the flag staunchly in his hands and marches up the aisle and then
   down the aisle, signifying-what? Ne'mind! But exactly! Don't explain it.
   Do it!

   LIKE MOST CONFERENCES, THIS ONE HAD A CAREFULLY prepared and printed
   schedule of meals, talks, seminars, group activities. The Pranksters made
   a good quick hash of that. They had no schedule and intimated nobody else
   should, either. The Sport Shirts would have a big seminar planned to
   capture the imagination of the Youth-something on the order of Student
   Rebellion in an Age of Mediocrity: Challenge and Responsibility-only at
   the appointed hour the Youth, the student rebels in an age of mediocrity,
   would be down by the beach, down around the damnable bus, where the
   Pranksters had their own program, and no schedule, friends and neighbors,
   everything happens at the hour of  Now and all can join in the game of
   Power:::::

   Somebody wins the Power and orders a game of football to be played on the
   beach, only with the Hermit as the football. Presently a whole group,
   Pranksters, ministers, conferees, are picking up the giggling Hermit and
   handing him off like a quarterback would and scrambling for him like a
   loose football, and so on. But soon the grief of it-allegory!-begins to
   sink in, this making of a human being a counter in the power game, always
   the weakest... Ahhh! One of the young ministers, one of the Young Turks,
   now has the power, and he orders that all go into the surf of the Pacific
   and wash one another's feet. Ritual of humility, allegory of life, but not
   a word of explanation need be spoken, and they all just sit down in the
   surf and wash one another's feet, and the Hermit's most meticulously, and
   the Pranksters really groove with this. They think this is great. And the
   kids now look at the Young Turk whose inspiration it was in a new light.
   He has made it. The Pranksters approve of him!

   The Young Turks spent more and more time with the Pranksters, late into
   the night, while the music played on the bus, and the Pranksters brought
   huge strands of kelp out of the ocean and flailed it about and beat the
   sides of the bus with it, like a huge drum, and played the Power game and
   took the Now Trip and played the non-games of life, and kept rapping away,
   but more than rapping, being, being alive-the Young Turks were truly on
   the bus. From the lack of sleep and the pace and weird shaking of the
   foundations, they began to feel the mysto thing most profoundly.

   Paul Sawyer was walking back to go to bed about 7 a.m. one morning after
   an all-night stand with the Pranksters when he was met by a delegation of
   conference officials. They wanted to have it out. They wanted to ask Kesey
   and the Pranksters to leave. Kesey might be sincere, they said, and he
   might not. But in any case he was disrupting the conference and causing a
   schism in the conferees, and setting an atrocious example for the Youth.
   It seemed that Dr. -, one of the Church's greatest liberals and a leader
   in the civil-rights movement, had already left the conference in protest
   and taken a couple of other ministers with him.

   -Wait a minute, says Sawyer. We called this conference to shake the
   foundations. And, well, now they are beginning to shake, and it's time to
   see whether we have the courage of our convictions.

   -Well, yes, Paul, but there are these things they are doing, and the park
   officials are quite upset. First of all, there is a very strong suspicion
   that they are indulging in marijuana. There is a very peculiar smell
   around that bus. But let us leave that aside. In any case, the bus is a
   very definite health nuisance, all those people living together on that
   bus by the side of the water. It isn't sanitary. But let us leave that
   aside, too. There is also the incident of the shower room. Park personnel
   caught two of these. . . Pranksters taking a shower together, a man and a
   woman, in the men's shower room. Now we might overlook that sort of thing,
   but what kind of an example is that for the young people? And this one
   they call Mountain Girl. Every time she sees Dr. George Washington Henry,
   who is after all one of our most distinguished Negro ministers and
   thinkers, she yells out, "Watermelon Henry!"

   -Watermelon Henry?

   -Yes, it seems she saw him eating a watermelon the other day, and
   "enjoying it," as she insists on saying, and so now, every time she sees
   him, she sings out, "Watermelon Henry!" And you know the kind of voice she
   has. I suppose that's "bringing it all out front," or whatever they call
   it-but really-Watermelon Henry-

   The upshot is, they want to throw the whole bunch out. But Sawyer holds
   his ground and says that if Kesey and the Pranksters are expelled, he is
   leaving too. This posed the possibility of a walkout of the Young Turks,
   which might create an even worse schism. So the elders agreed to ride it
   out.

   -We think you're making a mistake, Paul, Kesey is manipulating this
   conference.

   KESEY WAS, IN FACT, NOW TREMENDOUSLY INTERESTED IN THE whole phenomenon
   of. . . Control. He had discovered that the Pranksters had been able to
   control the flow of the conference, not by any Machiavellian planning, but
   simply by drawing the conference into their movie. The conference was on a
   schedule, but the Pranksters always arrived .. . Now, and in no time at
   all everyone had become a player in their movie. Kesey began to hold daily
   briefings for the Pranksters.

   -From now on, he's saying, we've got to stick to the same costume every
   day. Every Prankster's got to have a clear identity to everybody here, so
   that everywhere you go and they see you, you're on, it turns them on to
   your thing, the thing you're doing.

   Kesey has on the Yin-Yang jacket. Mountain Girl has on the purple robe.
   Babbs has on an incredible pair of pants of many-colored stripes, made by
   Gretch. And so forth.

   Mountain Girl objects.

   -I think we ought to forgit our own identity and the costumes and just do
   our thing and keep it open.

   -That's right, but that won't do any good if they don't have a clear idea
   of what our thing is.

   So they stuck to the costumes and it worked. Hour by hour it became clear
   that the Pranksters were on to a secret of... Control, in each and every
   situation.

   Kesey's sense of timing was perfect. By Friday, Kesey had done a lot of
   talking, on stage, off stage, down by the bus, and things had gotten to
   the point where people might start saying, well, for a guy who says
   talking won't get the job done, he has done an awful lot of talking. Kesey
   emerged from the bus that afternoon with a huge swath of adhesive tape
   plastered across his mouth. He went around the whole day like that,
   silent, plastered over, as if to say, I'm through talking.

   All the kids at Asilomar thought this was great, too. More and more of
   them were hanging around the bus, while the Pranksters flung kelp about
   and played like very children themselves. Nighttime and one girl really
   feels into the thing, and she wants nothing more in this world than to go
   on an acid trip with the Pranksters. She has never taken acid before. So
   they give her some and a group of them take acid, down by the bus, by the
   ocean, and christ, she starts freaking out. She starts wailing away.
   That's all they need. This one thing could wreck everything they've done.
   So Kesey quick says give her total Attention. So they gather around her,
   all the Pranksters, and bathe her in love and Attention and she breaks
   through the freakout, comes through the other side and starts grooving on
   it, and it's beautiful. It's like all the Pranksters' theories and
   professed beliefs have been put to a test in the outside world, away from
   La Honda, and they're working now, and they have ... Control.

   ON THE LAST DAY, SUNDAY, THE KIDS AT THE CONFERENCE PUT on a show,
   apparently a tradition at the conference. But this show is all about the
   Pranksters. They have a kid impersonating practically every Prankster. The
   best one they did was the Hermit, scuttling and sniggling and giggling
   around. But they also did Kesey and Babbs and some others. The grand
   finale of the show was a musical number, "Kelp I Need Somebody!", sung to
   the tune of the Beatles' song "Help!"

   The Sports Shirts looked and endured. They had ridden it out and at least
   they had avoided a schism. Or had they? Hmmm-mmm....

   Paul Sawyer looked at Kesey ... and he saw a prophetic figure. He had not
   taught or preached. Rather, he had created ... an experience, an awareness
   that flashed deeper than cerebration. Somehow he was in the tradition of
   the great prophets. The modern world knows prophets only in the stiff,
   reverent language of the texts and scholarly limnings of various
   religions. Somehow Kesey had created the prophetic aura itself, and
   through the Pranksters many people at the conference had not observed but
   experienced mystic brotherhood, albeit ever so bizarre ... a miracle in
   seven days.

   THE FOLLOWING YEAR THERE WERE TWO CONFERENCES OF THE Unitarian Church.
   One, as always, was at Asilomar. And the Sport Shirts were there, as
   always. The other was in the High Sierras. The Young Turks held their own
   conference, in the High Sierras, up in the thin air. Somehow it wasn't
   quite what they expected, however. A certain psychic decibel level was
   lacking. Nevertheless, the age of bullshit was over. They were on the bus
   for good. The next year Sawyer spent a month living in Haight-Ashbury, to
   explore the possibilities of a new kind of ministry for the young people;
   on the bus, as it were.

   OH, THE VI-BRA-TIONS . . .

   IT SO HAPPENED THAT ONE OF THE FEMALE DELEGATES TO THE Unitarian
   conference at Asilomar had her own little resume of the conference printed
   up, and she mailed it out. The Pranksters read it out loud in the living
   room at Kesey's:

   "So the Prophet Kesey came before us"-and did such and such.

   "And the Prophet Kesey said"-this and that.

   "And the Prophet Kesey made a sign"-signifying Christ knows what.

   "And it was good, for as the Prophet Kesey says"-

   -repeating this phrase, the Prophet Kesey, and adorning it with all the
   biblical rhetoric-only she was serious! straight! rapt! a true believer!
   and probably thought the Prophet Kesey would beam when he saw it.

   So the Pranksters all look at Kesey. He has his head down and he says in a
   melancholy way:

   "We're not on the Christ Trip. That's been done, and it doesn't work. You
   prove your point, and then you have 2,000 years of war. We know where that
   trip goes."

   All the same, it was a sensitive moment. The old girl had tried to put it
   all into so many words-Kesey's role and the whole direction the Pranksters
   were taking. All the Pranksters-we're on some kind of trip, Christ knows.
   They all had religion, all right. It was ... like the whole Prankster
   thing was now building up some kind of conclusion, some ... ascension, and
   no one could give it a right name and still be called sane. A great
   burning column, reaching about the western horizon, perhaps .. .

   Kesey himself was like someone possessed. The goddamn scene here is enough
   to drive anybody off the freaking platter. It's getting like a circus,
   every freak in California now showing up, heads, bums, students, raggy
   little girls come looking for excitement, looking to get spaced out on LSD
   or for Christ knows what reason. Even spades turning up, like Heavy, who
   rises up in the woods in the middle of the night among the tents croaking
   like a bullfrog: Have no worry, have no fear, hash-smokin' Heavy's here.
   ..

   It's even gotten to Babbs, this motley collection. "This is a zoo!" he's
   saying to Kesey. "This is where the love stuff gets you!

   But Kesey says, "When you've got something like we've got, you can't just
   sit on it. You've got to move off of it. You can't just sit on it and
   possess it, you've got to move off of it and give it to other people. It
   only works if you bring other people into it."

   So everybody who wanted could stay, Prankster or not, and the more-who
   gives a shit. Kesey also had his court appearances to contend with and
   more lying, finking, framing, politicking by the constables than a body
   could believe-he looked like he had aged ten years in three months. He was
   now some indeterminate age between thirty and forty. He was taking a lot
   of speed and smoking a lot of grass. He looked haggard, and when he looked
   haggard, his face seemed lopsided. One day he came stumbling out of the
   backhouse and Sandy saw him and one eye seemed to be aimed one way and one
   the other, as if there had been a horrible wrench . .. although the grim
   shit was beginning to hit Sandy again, too ...

   No turning back, man! We're on the space ship now, fly by ... Control...
   and Attention . .. going with the flow and we can't duck the weird shit,
   no matter how weird it is. Kesey was doing some acid rapping, taking 500,
   1,000, 1,500 micrograms instead of the normal 100 to 250. He had always
   been against that. Acid rappers, freaks who made a competition out of who
   could take the most acid-they all seemed to end up loose in the head, that
   breed. But now it was as if no experiment could be left undone.

   One night Kesey took about 1,500 micrograms and several other Pranksters
   took lesser doses and they got down on the floor and started the Humanoid
   Radio. They started babbling, going into echolalia, ululation, all manner
   of nonverbal expression, talking in Tongues, as it were. The idea was to
   try to hit that beam and that mode that would enable you to communicate
   with beings on other planets, other galaxies ... They were all high as
   hell, of course, but one thought shot through the manic dendrite raps like
   a subliminal legend: What if-and you'll never know until you do it if you
   have the

   power! they're sitting around a big round table in kesey's living room. It
   is a big wooden table, now covered with the carved initials and
   inscriptions of Hell's Angels, "Ralph of Oakland," and so on, playing the
   game of Power. Page Browning wins and he orders: Now we all take DMT and
   hold hands, seated in a circle around the table.

   And rrrrrrrrrrush those fantastic neon bubbles rushing up out of the heart
   square into the human squash and bursting into-skull mirrors! out of
   Nipponese kaleidoscope got it down Grant through a door of tesselated
   straw over the carvings of the Hell's Angels on the table here brought
   into The Movie because now, Hondo, on the space craft you can deal with
   anyone just imagine them into The Movie, get so totally into the moment
   that whichever way you move the entire moment moves with you, not causing,
   bub, just flowing-Go with the flow-Go

   Outside

   Kesey hears a voice and it tells him to get up from the table, and he
   does, and there are Page and other Pranksters spaced out of their gourds
   and holding hands and ... keening, with their eyes closed because like
   with DMT opening your eyes doesn't change a thing-those eyelid movies just
   keep on pouring out into the living room and Kesey goes outside in the
   dark in the cool of the redwood dell and now it-

   I am the Ace and Faye is the Red Queen

   Whump?

   in a flash the water heater out back of the house in the dark-meaning-if
   he gestures it will

   and he gestures and it is blown up, the heater, demolished, a hell of a
   blast-the voice says

   Go OUT UPON THE MAIN ROAD

   and he goes out over the wooden bridge, out onto Route 84 in the dark with
   only the smallest blowwwwwwnnn glow from the house to be seen, and a wind
   comes up. Weird shit, Major-the wind never comes up in this gorge with all
   these hills and trees around and strange the wind lifts under the thoracic
   box and every convex leaf and the balloon canopy cathedral bowers and now;
   he; is;

   Afterwards he knows it was the drug. And yet-Walker had been driving up
   near Skylonda in that selfsame moment and had suddenly felt a wind rise
   and said, How very strange! Too much!

   Oh yes, Major, it was the drug, you understand-and yet-he was fully into

   a hulking great sign on the gate out front

                    The Merry Pranksters Welcome the Beatles

   The Beatles were going to be at the Cow Palace outside of San Francisco on
   the evening of September 2. The papers, the radio, the TV could talk of
   nothing else. Kesey's idea, the current fantasy, is that after the show
   the Beatles will come to La Honda for a good freaking rout with the Merry
   Pranksters. Now as to how this is to all come about...

   But one has to admit the sign creates an effect.

                    The Merry Pranksters Welcome the Beatles

   Out on Route 84, Mom&Dad&Buddy&Sis in their Ocelot Rabies 400 hardtop
   sedans, they slow down and stop and stare. The last sign, the one reading
   The Merry Pranksters Welcome the Hell's Angels, for that one they mainly
   just slowed down. After all, it didn't say when. It might be 30 seconds
   from now-hundreds of the beasts, coming 'round the mountain in a shower of
   spirochetes and crab lice, spitting out bone marrow from the last cannibal
   rape job up the road.

   Well, it worked with the Hell's Angels. They put up the sign The Merry
   Pranksters Welcome the Hell's Angels, and sure enough the Angels came,
   these unbelievable bogeymen for the middle class, in the flesh, and they
   became part of the Prankster movie, in the rich ripe cheesy Angel flesh.
   So they put up the sign The Merry Pranksters Welcome the Beatles and maybe
   the Beatles will come. There is this one small difference of course. Kesey
   knew the Hell's Angels. He invited them, face to face. Ah, but comes a
   time to put a few professed beliefs to the test. Control, Attention,
   Imagine the little freaks into the movie ...

   Kesey raps on to Mountain Girl out in the backhouse. They lie there on the
   mattresses, with Kesey rapping on and on and Mountain Girl trying to
   absorb it. Ever since Asilomar, Kesey has been deep into the religion
   thing. Miracles-Control-Now- The Movie-on and on he talks to Mountain Girl
   out in the backhouse and very deep and far-out stuff it is, too. Mountain
   Girl tries to concentrate, but the words swim like great waves of. .. The
   words swim by and she hears the sound but it is like her cerebral cortex
   is tuned out to the content of it. Her mind keeps rolling and spinning
   over another set of data, always the same. Like-the eternal desperate
   calculation. In short, Mountain Girl is pregnant.

   And yet with all this desperation rolling and spinning going on, something
   he says will catch hold. They are that bizarre, but that plausible,
   Kesey's dreams are. It's a matter of imagining them into the movie. The
   Beatles. It is like an experiment in everything the Pranksters have
   learned up to now. We can't make the Beatles come out here to our place.
   We can't cause them to do it in the usual sense. But we can imagine them
   into the movie and work them into the great flow of acausal connection and
   then it will happen of its own accord. This sign starts the movie going,
   The Merry Pranksters Welcome the Beatles, and our movie becomes their
   movie, Mom's and Dad's and Buddy's and Sis's and all the Berkeley kids'
   and all the heads' and proto-heads' of the San Francisco peninsula, until
   our fantasy becomes the Beatles' fantasy ... Wonder when they will first
   feel it... Despite the rolling and spinning and all, Mountain Girl can't
   hardly help but marvel at the current fantasy because there has already
   been so much ... weird shit... that worked. Bringing the Angels in, like
   Kesey did, the most feared demons in America . . . and finding Good People
   like Buzzard and Sonny and Tiny and Frank and Terry the Tramp, who Done
   Well, and Beautiful People like Gut... And the poor tortured intellectual
   angels at Asilomar, from Watermelon Henry to freaking Rachel-for a week
   Kesey had mystified, like mystified, and taken over the whole Unitarian
   Church of California. They would never be the same again, which was just
   as well. A true Miracle, in fact, since they had been the same for so
   goddamn long. Control :::: and it was so plausible, the way it sounded in
   Kesey's certain Oregon drawl. So few humans have the hubris to exert their
   wills upon the flow, maybe not more than forty on the whole planet at any
   given time. The world is flat, it is supported by forty, or maybe four,
   men, one at each corner, like the cosmic turtles and elephants in the
   mythology books, because no one else dares. Mountain Girl is 18 and she is
   pregnant, but this is Kesey ...

   And Miracles? You haven't seen miracles yet, Job, until you see the
   Pranksters draw the Beatles into their movie.

   SEPTEMBER 2. FAYE'S  SEWING MACHINE IS THE FIRST THING everyone hears as
   they wake up. Faye and Gretch pull out the big costume chest, full of all
   sorts of ungainly theatrical shit, swash-buckle swords and plumed hats and
   Errol Flynn dueling shirts and Robin Hood boots and quivers and quail
   masks and Day-Glo roadworker vests and sashes and medals and saris and
   sarongs and shades and beaks and bells and steelworker hard hats and World
   War I aviator helmets and Dr. Strange capes and cutlasses and codpieces
   and jumpsuits and football jerseys and aprons and ascots and wigs and
   warlock rattles and Jungle Jim jodhpurs and Captain Easy epaulets and
   Fearless Four tights-and Merry Prankster Page Browning special face
   paints. The Merry Pranksters are getting ready to head bombed out into the
   mightiest crazed throng in San Francisco history, come to see the Beatles
   at the Cow Palace.

   One of the Pranksters' outer circle, so to speak, a fellow called C--,
   from Palo Alto-C--had worked out some kind of a deal and gotten thirty
   tickets to the Beatles concert for the Pranksters, even though tickets
   were supposed to be impossible to get. C-was one of the Pranksters' acid
   sources. Another was an old guy known as the Mad Chemist, an amateur
   chemistry genius who was also a gun freak. Anyway, this C-- worked out
   some kind of a deal and he also got enough acid for everybody for the
   trip. Just before the Pranksters, inner and outer circle, and kids,
   climbed on the bus, Kesey grinned and passed out the acid. It was in
   capsules, but it was such high concentration it just coated part of the
   inside of the capsules, so it looked like there was nothing in there. The
   Pranksters called it acid gas. So they all took acid gas and got on the
   bus. Cassady was off somewhere, so Babbs drove. Kesey was up on top of the
   bus, directing the movie. Well, it was colorful enough, this movie. The
   bus was super-rigged, all the sound equipment, two big speakers up top,
   records and tapes, plus the whole Prankster band up top of the bus, George
   Walker's drums, and basses and guitars and trombones and plumes spilling
   out the windows and flashes of Day-Glo and flapping epaulets, freaking
   flashing epaulets, and the Beatles album from the movie Help! screaming
   out the speakers, and up on top, Kesey and Sandy, Mountain Girl, Walker,
   Zonker, and a new Prankster, a little girl called Mary Microgram, and
   guitars and drums-He-e-e-elp I ne-e-e-e-ed somebody-the whole flapping
   yahooing carnival of a bus bouncing and jouncing and grinding up over
   Skylonda, Cahill Ridge, and down through Palo Alto and out onto the Harbor
   Freeway heading toward San Francisco, a goddamn rolling circus once again.
   Everybody was getting kind of high on acid, wasted, in fact, and starting,
   one by one, Mountain Girl and Sandy and Norman, who was inside the bus, to
   have that thing where the motion and the roar of the bus and the beat of
   the music and the sound of it are all one thing rolling together, and like
   Babbs is driving to the exact tempo and speed of the Beatles music, since
   they are all one thing together, growing high as baboons down through the
   freaking motels and electric signs and gull lights in Burlingame, near the
   airport, the Hyatt House super-America motel spires aloft-pitching and
   rolling and gunning along in exact time to the Beatles music, that being
   the soundtrack of this movie, you understand-and then off the expressway
   at the Cow Palace exit and down the swerving-ne-e-e-ed some-body-ramp,
   down an incline, down a hill, toward dusk, with the fever millions of cars
   streaming south on the freeway and the sun a low bomb over the hills,
   zonked, in fact. And grinding down to the stop light, thunk, and the
   brakes sound like a cast-iron flute A below high C-and at that very
   moment, that very moment of bus stop-the Beatles song Help! ends, in that
   very moment, and weird music starts, from the part of the movie Help!
   where the Arab is sneaking up behind Ringo, and in that weird moment the
   wind rises over the freeway and to the right there is an abandoned
   factory, all brick and glass, mostly glass, great 1920s factory glass
   panes and all of them bending weird in the wind and flashing sheets of
   that huge afternoon sun like a huge thousand-eyed thing pulsing explosions
   of sunlight in exact time to the weird Arab music- and in that very moment
   Kesey, Mountain Girl, Sandy, Zonker, all of them-no one even has to look
   at another because they not only know that everyone else is seeing it at
   once, they feel, they feel it flowing through one brain, Atman and
   Brahman, all one on the bus and all one with the writhing mass sun
   reflector ripple sun bomb prisms, the bricks, the glass, the whole hulk of
   it, Pranksters and Beatles and sun bombs flashing Arab music- and then in
   that very moment, they all, the all in one, the one brain flow, see the
   mouldering sign silhoutted against the sky above the building:

                                     CLOUD

   Suddenly it seemed like the Pranksters could draw the whole universe into
   ... the movie ...

   AND THEN, CURIOUSLY, BEING AS IT IS, SO FREAKING HIGH OUT here-Mountain
   Girl thinks what the fuck is this. It looks like a slaughterhouse. In
   fact, it is the Cow Palace. She can't even focus on the big hulking
   building itself for the miles and endless rings of slaughterhouse fences
   around it, fences and barbed wire and a million cars jamming in and being
   jammed in in the cold fag end of the dusk. Curiously, it isn't terrifying
   to Mountain Girl, however. It is just a slaughterhouse, that's all.

   But to other Pranksters-a concentration camp. We're going to jail, for the
   rest of our lives only. Everybody scrambling down off the bus, all still
   in motion with the ground and the concentration-camp fences flailing in
   the gruesome gloaming while billions of teeny freaks rush by them,
   screaming and freaking. They have their tickets in their hand like it is
   the last corner of salvation extant but they can't even read the mothers.
   They are wasted. The letters on the ticket curdle and freak off into the
   teeny freak flow. Thirty Pranksters in full flapping epaulets and plumes
   desperately staring at the minute disappearing tickets in their hands in
   the barby ante-pens of the concentration camp. They are going to arrest us
   and lock us away for the rest of our lives. That seems very certain,
   almost like well, that's why we came. Thirty acid heads, with innocent
   children in tow, in full Prankster regalia, bombed out of their gourds on
   the dread LSD, veering, careening in delirium sun pulse. In public, stoned
   out of their skulls on LSD, not only in public but in this momentous
   heaving Beatles throng amid 2,000 red dog forensic cops, in full
   go-to-hell costume-exterminate the monsters-

   ... but... no one lays a hand on them or says the first word, thousands of
   cops and not even one hassle ... because we're too obvious. Suddenly it
   couldn't be clearer to Norman. We're too obvious and we've blown their
   brains. They can't focus on us- or-we've sucked them into the movie and
   dissolved the bastids-

   Inside the Cow Palace it is very roaring hell. Somehow Kesey and Babbs
   lead the Day-Glo crazies up to their seats. The Pranksters are sitting in
   a great clump, a wacky perch up high in precipitous pitch high up pitching
   down to the stage and millions of the screaming teeny freaks. The teeny
   freaks, tens of thousands of little girls, have gone raving mad already,
   even though the Beatles have not come on. Other groups, preliminaries,
   keep trooping on, And now-Martha and the Vandellas and the electrified
   throb and brang vibrates up your aorta and picks your bones like a sonic
   cleaner, and the teeny freaks scream-great sheets of scream like sheets of
   rain in a squall-and kheew, Xheew, pow, pow, pow-how very marvelous, how
   very clever, figures Norman. From up out of the Cow Palace horde of sheet
   scream teeny freaks comes this very marvelous clever light display,
   hundreds of exploding lights throughout the high intensity lights,
   ricocheting off everything, what a marvelous clever thing they've rigged
   up here for our ...

   -Mountain Girl smiles... the incredible exploding lights explode out in
   front of her, a great sea of them, and then they explode on her retina in
   great sunburst retinal sulphur rockets, images and after-images that she
   will never forget as long as she lives, in truth-

   ... for our entertainment, and it is twenty or thirty minutes before
   Norman, stoned, realizes that they are flashbulbs, hundreds, thousands of
   teeny freaks with flashbulb cameras, aimed at the stage or just shot off
   in optic orgasm. Sheets of screams, rock 'n' roll, blam blam, a sea of
   flashbulbs-perfect madness, of course.

   -Mountain Girl grins and takes it all in-

   Other Pranksters, stoned, are slowly getting up tight, however, including
   Kesey and Babbs. The vibrations are very bad, a poison madness in the air-

   Each group of musicians that goes off the stage-the horde thinks now the
   Beatles, but the Beatles don't come, some other group appears, and the sea
   of girls gets more and more intense and impatient and the screaming gets
   higher, and the thought slips into Norman's flailing flash-frayed brain
   stem ::: the human lung cannot go beyond this :::: and yet when the voice
   says And now-the Beatles-what else could he say?-and out they come on
   stage-them-John and George and Ringo and uh the other one-it might as well
   have been four imported vinyl dolls for all it was going to matter-that
   sound he thinks cannot get higher, it doubles, his eardrums ring like
   stamped metal with it and suddenly Ghhhhhhwooooooooowwwwww, it is like the
   whole thing has snapped, and the whole front section of the arena becomes
   a writhing, seething !mass of little girls waving their arms in the air,
   this mass of pink arms, it is all you can see, it is like a single
   colonial animal with a thousand waving pink tentacles-it is a single
   colonial animal with a thousand waving pink tentacles,

   -vibrating poison madness and filling the universe with the teeny agony
   torn out of them. It dawns on Kesey: it is one being. They have all been
   transformed into one being.

   -Mountain Girl grins and urges them on-its scream does not subside for a
   moment, during after or between numbers, the Beatles could be miming it
   for all it matters. But something else ... does. .. matter ... and Kesey
   sees it. One of the Beatles, John, George, Paul, dips his long electric
   guitar handle in one direction and the whole teeny horde ripples precisely
   along the line of energy he set off-and then in the other direction,
   precisely along that line. It causes them to grin, John and Paul and
   George and Ringo, rippling the poor huge freaked teeny beast this way and
   that-

   Control-it is perfectly obvious-they have brought this whole mass of human
   beings to the point where they are one, out of their skulls, one psyche,
   and they have utter control over them-but they don't know what in the hell
   to do with it, they haven't the first idea, and they will lose it. In
   Kesey the vibration is an awful anticipation of the snap-

   Ghhhhhwooooooooowwwww, thousands of teeny bodies hurtling toward the stage
   and a fence there and a solid line of cops, fighting to hurl the assault
   back, while the Beatles keep moving their chops and switching their hips
   around sunk like a dumb show under the universal scream. In that surge,
   just when you would have thought not another sound in the universe could
   break through, it starts-thwaaaac\-thwaaaac\-the sound of the folding
   chairs on the arena floor collapsing and smashing down on the floor, and
   the remains are down there amid the pink tentacles, crushed to a pulp,
   little bits and splinters that used to be folding chairs, debris being
   passed out from hand to hand traveling over the pink tentacles from one to
   the other like some hideously diseased lurching monster cockroaches. And
   then the girls start fainting, like suffocation, and getting tromped on,
   and they start handing out their bodies, cockroach chair debris and the
   bodies of little teeny freaks being shuttled out over the pitched sea like
   squashed lice picked off the beast, screaming and fainting and
   Ghhhhhwooooowwwwww again up against the cop fence while the Beatles cheese
   and mince at them in the dumb show, utterly helpless to ripple them or
   anything else now, with no control left-

   Cancer-Kesey has only to look and it is perfectly obvious-all of them, the
   teeny freaks and the Beatles, are one creature, caught in a state of sheer
   poison mad cancer. The Beatles are the creature's head. The teeny freaks
   are the body. But the head has lost control of the body and the body
   rebels and goes amok and that is what cancer is. The vibrations of it hit
   the Pranksters, in a clump, stoned out of their gourds, in sickening
   waves. Kesey-Babbs-they all feel it at once, and Norman.

   -Mountain Girl looks very surprised. She wants to see the rest of it. But
   Kesey and Babbs have decided they should all leave-before the Monster Snap
   occurs, the big cancer wrap-up of the whole process.

   -Wait a minute, says Mountain Girl.

   But the Pranksters get up in a clump and a rustle of plumes and epaulets
   and Day-Glo, zonked out of their heads on acid, and all sorts of people
   start getting up-but like, concrete. The more headway they make toward the
   exits, the more it becomes a claustrophobia of pens, an endless series of
   pens. They head down long corridors, all concrete, and already hundreds
   are jammed in the corridors, all looking kind of raggy-because- They get
   the total vibration from them-everybody has the one same feeling: suppose
   this thing snaps now and there is panic and everybody makes a rush for it,
   the exit, but there is no exit, only concrete walls and concrete ceilings
   weighing down like a thousand tons and ramps-toward nothing-leading
   down-then up in a great clump of hump-and then down, outside, there is the
   sky, but it is black, it is nighttime by now and sick ochre floodlights,
   but they have merely made it to another pen, more Cyclone fences and
   barbed wire with frantic raggy people-all fleeing-milling around in it
   like rats, trying to get to the exit, which is a turnstile, an upright
   turnstile with bars, like an iron maiden, and you have to get inside of
   it, totally, one person at a time, with a frantic crush on both sides, and
   even then you have only made it to another pen, a parking lot, with more
   Cyclone fence and barbed wire and now teeny freaks and cars crushed in
   here, all trying to get out, seven and eight cars at a whack trying to
   nose through an opening big enough for one. Cages, cages, cages and no end
   to it. Even out there, beyond, where cars have escaped and they are in a
   line with their lights on-trapped by the hills, which are another great
   pen trapping the whole place in ... in ... The Pranksters all silent and
   numb with the apprehension of the Great Cancer Snap to come-

   -Except that Mountain Girl says Wait a minute-

   -and Zonker, with his huge euphoric Zonker grin on, fraternizing madly
   with all teeny freaks as they stream out, saying to all who listen: "The
   Beatles are going to Kesey's when they leave here . . . the Beatles are
   going to Kesey's . . ." and the word spreads among the crowd in the most
   delirious way-

   Kesey plunges back in for survivors. See if there are any Pranksters
   trapped inside. He tells the rest to go to the bus and stay there, and he
   plunges in. The Pranksters touch the bus and their morale revives a bit.
   They rev up the amplifiers and the speakers and climb up on top in their
   crazy costumes and start idling over the drums and the electric guitars.
   The thousands of little raggy girls keep pouring out into the parking lot,
   still wound up like a motorcycle and no release and of course they see the
   bus and these strange Day-Glo people. One group of kids is protesting that
   the music business is rigged and they're carrying placards and screaming
   and they figure the Pranksters support them-the Pranksters grin and wave
   back-everybody figures the strange Day-Glo people are for whatever they're
   for. They start piling around the bus, these little teeny freaks, and
   start pelting it with jelly beans, the hard kind, the kind they brought to
   throw at the Beatles. The Pranksters sit on top of the bus with the jelly
   beans clattering off the side and the flaming little teeny freaks pressed
   around screaming-So this is what the Beatles feel, this mindless amok
   energy surging at them for-what?

   At last Kesey returns with the last to be rescued, Mary Microgram, looking
   like a countryside after a long and fierce war, and Kesey says let's haul
   ass out of here. Babbs starts the bus up and they pull out, bulling their
   way slowly out toward freedom.

   Cancer! We saw it. It was there. Bad vibrations, say all. Endless cages.
   They all rock and sway, stoned on acid.

   "Hell," thinks Mountain Girl. "I have to come here with a bunch of old men
   who never saw a rock 'n' roll show before."

   ON THE WAY BACK THEY PUT THE BEATLES TAPE ON AGAIN, from Help! but it was
   no use. They were all too dispirited. Except for Mountain Girl and Zonker.
   Mountain Girl said she'd wanted to stay and see the rest of the show.
   Well-what the hell. Zonker was smiling about the Beatles coming. Well-that
   was what he had told the whole world anyway. And where the hell else would
   they go from there? In fact, the current fantasy-the imminent arrival of
   the Beatles-had hardly crossed anybody's mind for the last hour, not even
   Kesey's. Get the hell out of there, that was the main thing. Where were
   the Beatles? Who the hell knew. The little vinyl dolls had probably
   cheesed and minced off into a time warp. ... In any case, it wasn't very
   hulking likely they were coming to La Honda.

   Finally the bus comes grinding around the last curve round the mountain,
   up to Kesey's place, and the bus noses across the bridge and the
   headlights hit the yard-and the sight is gruesome and comical at the same
   time. It is like a super version of the nightmare of the man who just
   wants to go home and go to bed. The Pranksters have guests. In fact, they
   have three or four hundred guests. They are all jammed into the big yard
   between the main house and the backhouse, with big bitter lollipop eyes.
   It's like every head, freak, boho, and weirdo in the West has assembled in
   one spot, the first freakout, with a couple of hundred teeny freaks thrown
   in for good measure. Half of them are hunkered down with their big
   lollipop eyes turned up like somebody spit them up against the house and
   they slid down to the ground like slugs. Naturally they all came for the
   big beano with the Beatles. The party. Zonker did his work in the highest
   Prankster tradition. The sign still hangs on the gate:

                    The Merry Pranksters Welcome the Beatles

   Kesey is not in the mood for a goddamned thing and heads into the house.
   The whole head-freak-boho-slug mob stares at him, all these lollipop eyes,
   as if he is going to produce the Beatles from out of a sleeve. Then they
   start grumbling, like a bunch of prisoners who haven't been fed but don't
   know whether this is the time for the slave revolt or not. It is a
   debacle, except that it is so damned comical. The look on their faces.
   That, and the appearance of Owsley.

   A COCKY LITTLE GUY, SHORT, WITH DARK HAIR, DRESSED LIKE an acid head, the
   usual boho gear, but with a strange wound-up nasal voice, like a head with
   the instincts of a roller-skating rink promoter-this little character
   materializes in front of Kesey from out of the boho-slub multitudes and
   announces:

   "I'm Owsley."

   Kesey doesn't say Hi, I'm Kesey. He just looks at him, as if to say, all
   right, you're Owsley and you're here-and then what?

   Owsley looks stunned-I'm Owsley. In fact, Kesey never heard of him. It was
   like, if Owsley suddenly found himself in a place where nobody ever heard
   of him, he didn't know what to do. He and Kesey are just standing there
   trading eyeballs until finally Owsley produces a little bag he has and
   opens it and it is full of capsules of acid. He's Owsley, the greatest LSD
   manufacturer in the world, which turns out to be just about right, the
   Sandoz Chemical Corporation included.

   Mountain Girl looks and just smiles. Everything gets funnier and funnier
   on the Beatles patrol ! He's got his little bag of acid. Mountain Girl
   figures him for a wiseacre right away. Kesey looks at the bagful of acid.
   One thing the little wiseacre's got is acid.

   The world's greatest acid manufacturer, bar none, standing out in the dark
   in the middle of nowhere amid the boho-slug multitudes under the shadowy
   redwoods.

   By and by they had most of the boho-slubs off the place and sliding up the
   highway in the dark looking for christ knows what, seeing as how the
   Beatles never made it. Kesey and Owsley and the Pranksters sat down around
   a fire out by the big stump. And who the hell shows up but the Mad
   Chemist. He and Owsley start sniffing and eyeing each other. It's like the
   slick sharp young neurological doctor genius from out of the Mayo Clinic
   face to face with the old blowsy homey country doctor-on the most puzzling
   and difficult case in the history of medicine. Owsley and the Mad Chemist
   start arguing over drugs. It's like a debate. All of the Pranksters, even
   Kesey, keep out of it and the two of them start hammering away. Let the
   little wiseacre have it, Mad Chemist, Mountain Girl keeps thinking and
   most of the Pranksters feel the same way. But Owsley, the little wiseacre,
   is tearing him up. Owsley is young and sharp and quick and the Mad
   Chemist-the Mad Chemist is an old man and he has taken too much dope. He's
   loose in the head. He tries to argue and his brains all run together like
   goo. Owsley, the Pranksters figure-well, maybe he never even took acid
   himself. Or maybe he took it once. It is just something they sense. And
   the poor old Mad Chemist, he has taken so much dope-caressing his guns and
   hooking down dope-he is loose in the head, and Owsley just tears him up.
   The Mad Chemist is getting crushed. The Mad Chemist never came around
   again but once or twice, it was all so humiliating. So the Pranksters had
   this little wiseacre Owsley on their hands whether they liked it or not.
   But he did make righteous acid and he had money. Between the two of them,
   Owsley and the Pranksters, they were about to put LSD all over the face of
   the globe.

   Little by little, Owsley's history seeped out. He was 30 years old,
   although he looked younger, and he had a huge sonorous name: Augustus
   Owsley Stanley III. His grandfather was a United States Senator from
   Kentucky. Owsley apparently had had a somewhat hungup time as a boy, going
   from prep school to prep school and then to a public high school, dropping
   out of that, but getting into the University of Virginia School of
   Engineering, apparently because of his flair for sciences, then dropping
   out of that. He finally wound up enrolling in the University of
   California, in Berkley, where he hooked up with a hip, good-looking
   chemistry major named Melissa. They dropped out of the University and
   Owsley set up his first acid factory at 1647 Virginia Street, Berkeley. He
   was doing a huge business when he got raided on February 21, 1965. He got
   off, however, because there was no law against making, taking, or having
   LSD in California until October 1966. He moved his operation to Los
   Angeles, 2205 Lafler Road, called himself the Baer Research Group, and
   paid out $20,000 in $100 bills to the Cycle Chemical Corporation for 500
   grams of lysergic acid monohydrate, the basic material in LSD, which he
   could convert into 1.5 million doses of LSD at from $1 to $2 apiece
   wholesale. He bought another 300 grams from International Chemical and
   Nuclear Corporation. His first big shipment arrived March 30, 1965.

   He had a flair, this Owsley. By and by he had turned out several million
   doses of LSD, in capsules and tablets. They had various whimsical emblems
   on them, to indicate the strength. The most famous, among the heads, were
   the "Owsley blues"-with a picture of Batman on them, 500 micrograms worth
   of Superhero inside your skull. The heads rapped over Owsley blues like
   old juice heads drawling over that famous onetime brand from Owsley's
   Virginia home territory, Fairfax County Bourbon, bottled in bond. Owsley
   makes righteous acid, said the heads. Personally he wasn't winning any
   popularity contests with the heads or the cops, either. He is, like,
   arrogant; he is a wiseacre; but the arrogant little wiseacre makes
   righteous acid.

   In fact, Owsley's acid was famous internationally. When the acid scene
   spread to England in late 1966 and 1967, the hippest intelligence one
   could pass around was that one was in possession of "Owsley acid." In the
   acid world, this was bottled-in-bond; certified; guaranteed; and high
   status. It was in this head world that the ... Beatles first took LSD.
   Now, just to get ahead of the story a bit-after Owsley hooked up with
   Kesey and the Pranksters, he began a musical group called the Grateful
   Dead. Through the Dead's experience with the Pranksters was born the sound
   known as "acid rock." And it was that sound that the Beatles picked up on,
   after they started taking acid, to do a famous series of acid-rock record
   albums, Revolver, Rubber Soul, and Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts' Club
   Band. Early in 1967 the Beatles got a fabulous idea. They got hold of a
   huge school bus and piled into it with thirty-nine friends and drove and
   wove across the British countryside, zonked out of their gourds. They were
   going to ... make a movie. Not an ordinary movie, but a totally
   spontaneous movie, using hand-held cameras, shooting the experience as it
   happened-off the top of the head!-cavorting, rapping on, soaring in the
   moment, visionary chaos-a daydream! a black art! a chaos! They finished up
   with miles and miles of film, a monster, a veritable morass of it, all
   shaky and out of focus-blissful Zonk!-which they saw as a total
   breakthrough in terms of expression but also as a commercial display-shown
   on British TV it was-that might be appreciated even outside the esoteric
   world of the heads-

                                   The Movie

   -called Magical Mystery Tour. And . . . the great banner rippled on the
   Prankster gate in the nighttime in ripples and intergalactic billows of
   great howling owsley electro-mad-chemical synchronicity...

                              The Merry Pranksters

                              Welcome the Beatles

                                    chapter

                                      XVI

                              The Frozen Jug Band

   SYNCHRONICITY SPOKEN HERE!

   -and the Pranksters sit around Kesey's living room at night, grooving on
   many strange events. Like the day of the great Blackout in New York City,
   the great power failure that knocked out subways, elevators, lights, air
   conditioners, TVs, clocks, buildings and the rest of the hulks in the
   great cancer capital of the East. The Pranksters grooved over the
   cataclysm and grokked it. Such consternation in the cancer capital! A huge
   surge of electricity had suddenly rolled through the wires and freaking
   blown everything. The utility companies didn't know what had caused this
   surge, but bygod they had experts working on it and they would figure it
   out and such a surge would never occur again.

   A  surge, Mahavira?-

   Meanwhile, there was one story in the newspapers that the Pranksters
   grooved on most truly. It seems that some kid had been playing hooky from
   school in New York that day and had

   gone off to the movies finally and come out of the movie house about 5:15
   p.m. and started walking home, feeling guilty already, and he picked up a
   stick out of the gutter and he started whacking parking meters with it.
   When he got to the corner, he whacked the big utility pole there and

   IN THAT VERY MOMENT

   all the lights in New York went out

   NOW

   and the kid ran home in the dark, crying, confessing all to his mother- I
   did it, I did it, but I didn't mean to-

   And Kesey and the Pranksters did groove on that. The kid was right, that
   was the funny part. Or at least as right as the utility companies. For no
   doubt there was a great surge, friends, and it came through that kid just
   like it came through everything and every being that existed in that
   moment. Just as Severn Darden blew out the candles on his birthday cake in
   that very moment-and they poked through every Con Ed transformer in the
   system and they never did find the cause.

   Cosmo!

   -and once you find out about Cosmo, you know he's running the show. . .
   It's like we're strands of wire intertwined in a great cable that runs
   through a slot, the Pranksters, the Beatles, the Vietnam Day Committee-the
   Vietnam Day Committee?-running through a slot, and all the wires are
   vibrated by Cosmo. Most people lead two-dimensional lives. All they can
   see is the face of the slot, a cross section, so that the wires look like
   a mass of separate little circles looking bigger or smaller according to
   how close you are. They don't-they can't see that these "circles" are just
   cross sections of wires that run backward and forward infinitely and that
   there is a great surge through the whole cable and that anybody who is
   truly into the full bare essence of the thing...

                                                  There is food in the thing.

                                                     My comrades are envious.

                                                     But they cannot harm me.

                                                                Good fortune.

                                                                 -the I Ching

   ... tends to react against political disorder because he is concerned with
   the deep basic religious experience, the deepest sources of life;
   transient politics are insignificant to him.

                                                                -Joachim Wach

   It was against this backdrop, namely, the ultimate and the infinite, that
   an organization known as the Vietnam Day Committee invited Kesey to come
   speak at a huge antiwar rally in Berkeley, on the University of California
   campus. I couldn't tell you what bright fellow thought of that, inviting
   Kesey. Afterwards, they didn't know, either. Or at least none of them
   would own up, despite a lot of interrogations and recriminations and
   general thrashing about. "Who the hell invited this bastard!" was the
   exact wording. A regular little rhubarb they had for themselves. The main
   trouble with the Vietnam Day Committee was that they couldn't see beyond
   the marvelous political whoopee they had cooked up. Why should they? From
   where they were looking in the fall of 1965, they were about to sweep the
   country. Berkeley, the New Left, the Free Speech Movement, Mario Savio,
   the Rebel Generation, the Student Revolution, in which students were going
   to take over the universities, like in Latin America, and drive some fire
   up the clammy rectum of American life-you could read about it in all the
   magazines. And if you don't believe it, come here and watch us, Mr.
   Jones-and so forth.

   They never looked beyond that, as I say, but it might have been no use, in
   any case. Maybe there was no way in the world anybody could have made the
   Vietnam Day Committee realize how their whole beano looked to Kesey and
   the Pranksters. Come rally against the war in Vietnam-from the cosmic
   vantage point the Pranksters had reached, there were so many reasons this
   little charade was pathetic, they didn't know where to begin . . .

   Nevertheless, Kesey was invited, and that was how the fun started.
   Marchers were pouring into Berkeley from seventy-one cities and
   twenty-eight states, for whatever such sums are worth-at any rate,
   thousands of students and professors from all over. There were to be
   teach-ins all day and also an all-day rally starting in the morning, with
   thirty or forty speakers to whip things up, and then at 7:30 in the
   evening, when the fever pitch was reached, they would all rise up off the
   Berkeley campus and march over into Oakland, fifteen or twenty thousand
   souls in a massive line, marching on the Oakland Army Terminal. The
   Oakland Army Terminal was where men and supplies were shipped out to
   Vietnam. Just to spice things up a bit-a large supply of gelignite had
   been stolen, and everybody had visions of Oakland, Berkeley, San
   Francisco, the whole clump, blowing up in a gelignite earthquake of cops,
   peaceniks, Birchers, and probably spades and innocent women and children.
   Nobody had any idea which side had stolen the gelignite, but that only
   made it better.

   The gelignite scare seemed to give Kesey the inspiration for this prank.
   Kesey's saving grace was that he never got serious where he could say it
   just as well with a cosmic joke. Kesey's fantasy for the occasion was to
   come upon the huge anti-war rally as a freaking military invasion. It was
   a true inspiration, this fantasy. They were going to rig up the bus as a
   rolling fortress with guns sticking out and all the Pranksters would dress
   military. Then they would get cars and rig them up the same way, and at
   the head of the whole convoy, there would be-the Hell's Angels, in running
   formation, absolutely adangle with swastikas. Swastikas. If would freaking
   blow their minds, or at least give their cool a test like it never had
   before.

   First they painted the whole bus a dull red color, the color of dried
   blood, in fact. Right on over the greatest riot of Day-Glo design in
   history went this bloody muck. But who gave a damn. Art is not eternal.
   Then they started painting military symbols on the dried blood, swastikas,
   American eagles, Iron Crosses, Viking crosses, Red Crosses, hammers &
   sickles, skulls & bones, anything as long as it looked rank. That very
   night, naturally, the seasonal rains started, and like the Chief said, art
   is not eternal. All the paint started running until it was the most dismal
   mess imaginable. Somehow that was appropriate. The next day, Gut and his
   girlfriend, Little People, showed up. Gut was in a kind of transition
   period, between the Angels and the Pranksters. He had his old Hell's
   Angels sleeveless denim jacket on, but he had taken the insignia off, the
   lettering and the emblem of a skull with a helmet on, but you could see
   where it had all been, because the denim was lighter underneath. It was
   what you might call a goodbye-but-not-forgotten Hell's Angels' jacket.
   Anyway, Gut amazed the Pranksters by painting a big beautiful American
   Eagle on the bus, a little primitive, but strong. The big hulking jesus
   angel had talent. The Pranksters were all pleased as hell. They felt they
   had brought it out of him, somehow. Gut got everybody revved up. They
   built a gun turret on the bus and rigged up two big gray cannons that you
   could maneuver. Norman made a machine gun out of wood and cardboard and
   painted it olive drab. Other people were knocking together wooden guns of
   various ridiculous descriptions. Faye's sewing machine was going.
   Pranksters, inner circle and outer circle, were driving in from all over.
   Lee Quarnstrom, of the outer circle, showed up with a huge supply of Army
   insignia, shoulder patches, arm patches, hashmarks, bars, stars, epaulets.
   Kesey was rigging up the bus with tapes and microphones and amplifiers and
   earphones and electric guitars. Hagen was rigging up his 16-millimeter
   camera and films. Bob Dylan and the Beatles and Joan Baez and Roland Kirk
   and Mississippi John Hunt were droning and clattering over the big
   speakers from over the way atop the dirt cliff. Then Allen Ginsberg turned
   up from Big Sur, with his companion Peter Orlovsky and an entourage of
   pale Chester A. Arthur High School hindus. Ginsberg sang mantras all night
   and jingled bells and finger cymbals. Cassady hooked down speed and worked
   himself up from a standing start, jerking, kicking, dancing-he seemed to
   be moving in time to the sewing machine on a long seam. Ginsberg seemed to
   be chanting in time to a Jainist's whisk broom. Cassady began fibrillating
   the vocal cords, going faster and faster until by dawn if he had gone any
   faster, he would have vibrated off, as old Charles Fort said, and gone
   instantly into the positive absolute. It was a nice weird party.

   The next morning, October 16, the big day-the Pranksters blew the morning,
   naturally, all stroked out in various attitudes from the night before, and
   they were late getting off to Berkeley. Art is not eternal, friends. The
   plan was to meet the Hell's Angels in Palo Alto and go roaring down the
   freeway in formation. They put on Prankster tapes and Cassady got in the
   driver's seat. Everybody climbed on in their crazed military costumes,
   Hassler, Hagen, Babbs, Gretch, Zonker, June the Goon, Roy Seburn, Dale
   Kesey and all sorts of people, even the Mad Chemist-he showed up for this
   one-and Mary Microgram at the last minute. And then Kesey got on. Kesey
   was wearing a big orange coat of the sort highway workers wear so cars
   will see them. He had hash-marks on the sleeves and some kind of floppy
   epaulets flapping on the shoulders. He had a big orange Day-Glo World War
   I helmet on his head. It was so big and came down so far over his forehead
   his eyes were like two little flashlight bulbs under the lid. Kesey got up
   in the gun turret and they were off. Before they got to Palo Alto, in
   Woodside, in fact, the cops stopped them and hassled them and checked them
   over. The Pranksters did the usual, leaped out with cameras and shotgun
   mikes and tape recorders, filming and taping everything the cops said, and
   the cops left, but it ate up time.

   "Aha," said the Mad Chemist, "the first skirmish."

   "The Prankster Alert is out," said Babbs.

   That was just about right. They kept getting stopped and hassled and
   checked over and losing time. They got to the rendezvous in Palo Alto-and
   no Hell's Angels. They waited and waited for the Angels, then gave up and
   took off down the expressway, to Berkeley.

   They didn't get to the Berkeley campus until almost dusk, and their
   arrival didn't make any very momentous impression at first. Now, a full
   phalanx of Hell's Angels, looking like a cross between the Gestapo and the
   Tonton Macoute-that would have been a different story, no doubt. Good and
   noisy, too. But as it was, the bus just pulled into the parking lot by the
   Student Union building and the Pranksters cut up as best they could,
   ack-acking their wooden guns at birds and planes. The big rally had been
   going on all day. They were out on a big lawn, or plaza, on the campus,
   about fifteen thousand of them, the toggle-coat bohemians, while the PA.
   loudspeakers boomed and rabbled and raked across them. There was a big
   platform set up for the speakers. There had been about forty of them, all
   roaring or fulminating or arguing cogently, which was always worse. The
   idea at these things is to keep building up momentum and tension and
   suspense until finally when it is time for action-in this case, the
   march-the signal launches them as one great welded body of believers and
   they are ready to march and take billy clubs upside the head and all the
   rest of it.

   All the shock workers of the tongue were there, speakers like Paul Jacobs,
   and M. S. Arnoni, who wore a prison uniform to the podium because his
   family had been wiped out in a German concentration camp during World War
   II-and out before them was a great sea of students and other Youth, the
   toggle-coat bohemians-toggle coats, Desert Boots, civil rights, down with
   the war in Vietnam-"... could call out to you from their graves or from
   the fields and rivers upon which their ashes were thrown, they would
   implore this generation of Americans not to be silent in the face of the
   genocidal atrocities committed on the people of Vietnam ..." and the words
   rolled in full forensic boom over the PA. systems.

                                     * * *

   THE FIRST PERSON IN THE VIETNAM DAY COMMITTEE CIRCLE to notice Kesey
   approaching the speaker's platform was Paul Krassner, the editor of The
   Realist magazine. Most of the Pranksters were still on the bus, fooling
   around with the guns for the befuddlement of the gawkers who happened by.
   Kesey, Babbs, Gretchen Fetchin and George Walker came on over the
   platform, Kesey in his orange Day-Glo coat and World War I helmet.
   Krassner ran his magazine as pretty much a one-man operation and he knew
   Kesey subscribed to it. So he wasn't so surprised that Kesey knew him.
   What got him was that Kesey just started talking to him, just like they
   had been having a conversation all along and something had interrupted
   them and now they were resuming... It is a weird thing. You feel the guy's
   charisma, to use that one, right away, busting out even through the nutty
   Day-Glo, or maybe sucking one in, the way someone once wrote of Gurdjieff:
   "You could not help being drawn, almost physically, towards him ... like
   being sucked in by a vast, spiritual vacuum cleaner." At the time,
   however, Krassner thought of Flash Gordon.

   "Look up there," Kesey says, motioning up toward the platform.

   Up there is Paul Jacobs. Jacobs tends toward the forensic, anyway, and the
   microphone and loudspeakers do something to a speaker. You can hear your
   voice rolling and thundering, powerful as Wotan, out over that ocean of
   big ears and eager faces, and you are omnipotent and more forensic and
   orotund and thunderous minute by minute-It is written, but I say unto you
   ... the jackals of history-ree-ree-ree-ree ... From where they are
   standing, off to the side of the platform, they can hear very little of
   what Jacobs is actually saying, but they can hear the sound barking and
   roaring and reverberating and they can hear the crowd roaring back and
   baying on cue, and they can see Jacobs, hunched over squat and thick into
   the microphone, with his hands stabbing out for emphasis, and there, at
   sundown, silhouetted against the florid sky, is his jaw, jutting out, like
   a cantaloupe ...

   Kesey says to Krassner: "Don't listen to the words, just the sound, and
   the gestures... who do you see?"

   And suddenly Krassner wants very badly to be right. It is the call of the
   old charisma. He wants to come up with the right answer.

   "Mussolini... ?"

   Kesey starts nodding, Right, right, but keeping his eye on the prognathous
   jaw.

   By this time more of the Pranksters have come up to the platform. They
   have found some electrical outlets and they have run long cords up to the
   platform, for the guitars and basses and horns. Kesey is the next to last
   speaker. He is to be followed by some final Real Barnburner of a speaker
   and then-the final surge and the march on Oakland.

   From the moment Kesey gets up there, it is a freaking jar. His jacket
   glows at dusk, and his helmet. Lined up behind him are more Day-Glo
   crazies, wearing aviator helmets and goggles and flight suits and Army
   tunics, Babbs, Gretch, Walker, Zonker, Mary Microgram, and little Day-Glo
   kids, and half of them carrying electric guitars and horns, mugging and
   moving around in Day-Glo streaks. The next jar is Kesey's voice, it is so
   non-forensic. He comes on soft, in the Oregon drawl, like he's just having
   a conversation with 15,000 people:

   You know, you're not gonna stop this war with this rally, by marching...
   That's what they do... They hold rallies and they march . .. They've been
   having wars for ten thousand years and you're not gonna stop it this way
   ... Ten thousand years, and this is the game they play to do it... holding
   rallies and having marches... and that's the same game you're playing...
   their game ...

   Whereupon he reaches into his great glowing Day-Glo coat and produces a
   harmonica and starts playing it right into the microphone, Home, home on
   the range, hawonking away on the goddamn thing-Home... home ... on the
   ra-a-a-a-ange ha-wonkawonk...

   The crowd stands there in a sudden tender clump, most of them wondering if
   they heard right, cocking their heads and rolling their heads to one
   another. First of all, that conversational tone all of a sudden, and then
   random notes from the Day-Glo crazies behind him ripped out offen the
   electric guitars and the general babble of the place feeding into the
   microphone-did anybody hear right-

   -all the while Kesey is still up there hawonking away on the freaking
   harmonica. Home, home on the ra-a-a-a-a-a-a-ange-

   -ahhhh, that's it-they figure it's some calculated piece of stage
   business, playing Home, home on the range-building up to something like
   Yah! We know about that home! We know about that range! That rotten U.S.
   home and that rotten U.S. range!- -but instead it is the same down-home
   drawling voice- I was just looking at the speaker who was up here before
   me... and I couldn't hear what he was saying... but I could hear the sound
   of it... and I could hear your sound coming back at him ... and I could
   see the gestures-

   -and here Kesey starts parodying Paul Jacobs's stabbing little hands and
   his hunched-over stance and his-

   -and I could see his jaw sticking out like this... silhouetted against the
   sky ... and you know who I saw ... and who I heard?... Mussolini... I saw
   and I heard Mussolini here just a few minutes ago... Yep ... you're
   playing their game...

   Then he starts hawonking away again, hawonking and hawonking Home, home on
   the range with that sad old setter harmonica-around-the-campfire pace-and
   the Pranksters back him up on their instruments, Babbs, Gretch, George,
   Zonker, weaving up there in a great Day-Glo freakout

   -and what the hell-a few boos, but mainly confusion-what in the name of
   God are the ninnies-

   -We've all heard all this and seen all this before, but we keep on doing
   it... I went to see the Beatles last month... And I heard 20,000 girls
   screaming together at the Beatles. .. and I couldn't hear what they were
   screaming, either... But you don't have to ... They're screaming Me! Me!
   Me! Me! ... I'm Me! ... That's the cry of the ego, and that's the cry of
   this rally!... Me! Me! Me! Me!... And that's why wars get fought... ego
   ... because enough people want to scream Pay attention to Me... Yep,
   you're playing their game...

   -and then more hawonkawonkawonkawonkawonka- -and the crowd starts going
   into a slump. It's as if the rally, the whole day, has been one long
   careful inflation of a helium balloon, preparing to take off-and suddenly
   somebody has pulled the plug. It's not what he is saying, either. It's the
   sound and the freaking sight and that goddamn mournful harmonica and that
   stupid Chinese music by the freaks standing up behind him. It's the only
   thing the martial spirit can't stand-a put-on, a prank, a shuck, a goose
   in the anus.

   -Vietnam Day Committee seethe together at the edge of the platform: "Who
   the hell invited this bastard!" "You invited him!" "Well, hell, we figured
   he's a writer, so he'll be against the war!" "Didn't you have enough
   speakers?" says Krassner. "You need all the big names you can get, to get
   the crowd out." "Well, that's what you get for being celebrity fuckers,"
   says Krassner. If they had had one of those big hooks like they had on
   amateur night in the vaudeville days, they would have pulled Kesey off the
   podium right then. Well, then, why doesn't somebody just go up there and
   edge him off! He's ruining the goddamn thing. But then they see all the
   Day-Glo crazies, men and women and children all weaving and electrified,
   clawing at guitars, blowing horns, all crazed aglow at sundown ... And the
   picture of the greatest anti-war rally in the history of America ending in
   a Day-Glo brawl to the tune of Home, home on the range ...

   -suddenly the hawonking on the freaking harmonica stops. Kesey leans into
   the microphone-

   There's only one thing to do . .. there's only one thing's gonna do any
   good at all... And that's everybody just look at it, look at the war, and
   turn your backs and say ... Fuck it...

   -hawonkawonkawonkawonka-

   -They hear that all right. The sound of the phrase-Fuck it-sounds so
   weird, so shocking, even here in Free Speech citadel, just coming out that
   way over a public loudspeaker, rolling over the heads of 15,000 souls-

   -Home, home on the range hawonkawonkawonka, and the Pranksters beginning
   to build up most madly on their instruments now, behind the harmonica,
   sounding like an insane honky-tonk version of Juan Carrillo who devised 96
   tones on the back seat of a Willys Jeep, saved pennies all through the war
   to buy it, you understand, zinc pennies until the blue pustules formed
   under his zither finger nether there, you understand .. .

   -Just look at it and turn away and say ... Fuck it

   -say ... Fuck it ...

   hawonkawonkawonka blam

   -Fuck it-

   Hawonkafuckit. . .friends . . .

   THERE WAS NO WAY ONE COULD PROVE KESEY HAD DONE IT. Nevertheless,
   something was gone out of the anti-war rally. The Real Barnburner spoke,
   and the Vietnam Day Committee tried to put in one last massive infusion of
   the old spirit and then gave the signal and the great march on Oakland
   began, through the gloaming. Fifteen thousand souls ... shoulder to
   shoulder like in the old strike posters. At the Oakland-Berkeley line
   there was an arrow-shaped phalanx of police and National Guard. The
   Vietnam Day Committee marched in frantic clump at the head, trying to
   decide whether to force the issue, have a physical confrontation, heads
   busted, bayonets-or turn back when they ordered them to. Nobody seemed to
   have any resolve. Somebody would say, We have no choice, we've got to turn
   back-and somebody else would call him a Martin Luther King. That was about
   the worst thing you could call anybody on the New Left at that time.
   Martin Luther King turned back at the critical moment on the bridge at
   Selma. We can't risk submitting the crania of our devoted people to
   fracturization and degradation by those who do not shrink from a cowardly
   show of weaponry, he had said, going on like Social Science Negro in his
   sepulchral voice-the big solemn preachery Uncle Tom. Yah! yuh
   Tuskegee-headed Uncle Tom, yuh, yuh Booker T Washington peanut-butter
   lecture-podium Nobel Prize medal head, yuh-Uncle Tom-by the time it was
   all over, Martin Luther King was a stupid music-hall Handkerchief Head on
   the New Left-and here they were, calling each other Martin Luther Kings
   and other incredible things-but nobody had any good smashing iron zeal to
   carry the day-O where is our Zea-lot, who Day-glowed and fucked up our
   heads-and there was nothing to do but grouse at the National Guard and
   turn back, which they did. What the hell has happened to us? Who did this?
   Why, it was the Masked Man-

   So the huge march turned around and headed for Civic Center Park in
   Berkeley and stood around there eating hamburgers and listening to music
   by a jug band-a group that later became known as Country Joe and the
   Fish-and wondering what the hell had happened. Then somebody started
   throwing tear gas from a rooftop and Bob Scheer was bravely telling
   everybody to lie down on the grass, because tear gas rises-but the jug
   band just stood there, petrified, with their hands and their instruments
   frozen in the same position as when the gas hit. It seems the jug band was
   high on something or other, and when the gas hit, the combination of the
   gas and whatever they were already up on-it petrified  them and they stood
   there in stark stiff medias res as if they were posing for an Iwo Jima
   sculpture for the biggest antiwar rally in the history of the American
   people. The whole rally now seemed like a big half ass, with the frozen
   jug band the picture of how far they had gotten.

   And then Kesey posted cryptic words on his log-house Prankster bulletin
   board:

   Let every thought, our whole direction, prepare for Mexico.

   Every morsel you eat, every book you read, every high, every

   low, every Day-Glo deed ...

   But he never said why or when they might expect to go.

   Now, Mountain Girl groks fully of the Pranksters' psychic takeoff

   And is the very radiometer of their superpsychic pace.

   No one ever plunged more fully in the psychedelic risk-all

   Or ever blazed more radiant through the splays of inner space.

   The demon Speed starts wrenching, leaves Sandy flinching in a bummer,

   Dazed again in a half-crazed demonic DMT implosion

   Causing psychosomatic, psychocidic cortical syndromes,

   Even synarthrotic paralysis down the side of his lean face.

   He tries to cure himself, purify the psychic venom,

   But they're no use-all the Prankster arts of this limelit magic place.

   Even I Ching says brain scans, EEGs, the whole clinical bit,

   Which costs money-Kesey! Let me pawn the Ampex,

   Four-hundred-dollar tape machine, for after all I brought it

   Here in the first place-and then-stuck in his synarthrotic cortex

   This thought: Kesey refused him the Ampex, Prankster salvation machine.

   He goes back East for the clinical bit, but that won't be the end of it,

   "CAN

   YOU

   PASS THE

   ACID TEST?-"

   Comes the call

   Chiseled on each Prankster eyeball in Lincoln gothic

   As we moan

   In this graveyard among moonstone tombstones with a philosophic

   It's your ass-

   Can you pass the Acid Test?

   Babbs and Kesey swaying

   In a California graveyard, baying deep

   In the synch

   Zonked on LSD on the brink

   freaking steep

   Of a missionary quest:

   Can you pass the Acid Test?

   Tombstones!

   Vaults, coffins and bald carbon-dated bones

   A dream transfusion

   From the Community Breast:

   Can you pass the Acid Test?

   The group mind

   Flying high, Major, but not blind

   in the moonshine

   Was inspired

   With the ceremony that would be required

   in the moon shot

   To extend

   The Prankster message to the ends

   Of the earth. A mindfest:

   a moon ship

   The Acid Test...

   ... and Kesey emerged from the weird night in the graveyard with the
   vision of turning on the world, literally, and a weirdly practical way of
   doing it, known as

   The Acid Test

   For, as it has been written:... he develops a strong urge to extend the
   message to all people ... he develops a ritus, often involving music,
   dance, liturgy, sacrifice, to achieve an objectified and stereotyped
   expression of the original spontaneous religious experience.

   Christ! how many movements before them had run into this selfsame problem.
   Every vision, every insight of the ... original ... circle always came out
   of the new experience... the kairos.. . and how to tell it! How to get it
   across to the multitudes who have never had this experience themselves?
   You couldn't put it into words. You had to create conditions in which they
   would feel an approximation of that feeling, the sublime pairos. You had
   to put them into ecstasy... Buddhist monks immersing themselves in cosmic
   love through fasting and contemplation, Hindus zonked out in Bhakti, which
   is fervent love in the possession of God, ecstatics flooding themselves
   with Krishna through sexual orgies or plunging into the dinners of the
   Bacchanalia, Christians off in Edge City through gnostic onanism or the
   Heart of Jesus or the Child Jesus with its running sore-or-

   The Acid Tests

   And suddenly Kesey sees that they, the Pranksers, already have the
   expertise and the machinery to create a mindblown state such as the world
   has never seen, totally wound up, lit up, amplified and . . .
   controlled-plus the most efficient key ever devised to open the doors in
   the mind of the world: namely, Owsley's LSD.

   For months Kesey has been trying to work out... the fantasy ... of the
   Dome. This was going to be a great geodesic dome on top of a cylindrical
   shaft. It would look like a great mushroom. Many levels. People would
   climb a stairway up the cylinder-buy a ticket?-we-e-e-elllll-and the dome
   would have a great foam-rubber floor they could lie down on. Sunk down in
   the foam rubber, below floor level, would be movie projectors, video-tape
   projectors, light projectors. All over the place, up in the dome,
   everywhere, would be speakers, microphones, tape machines, live, replay,
   variable lag. People could take LSD or speed or smoke grass and lie back
   and experience what they would, enclosed and submerged in a planet of
   lights and sounds such as the universe never knew. Lights, movies, video
   tapes, video tapes of themselves, flashing and swirling over the dome from
   the beams of searchlights rising from the floor from between their bodies.
   The sounds roiling around in the globe like a typhoon. Movies and tapes of
   the past, tapes and video tapes, broadcasts and pictures of the present,
   tapes and humanoid sounds of the future-but all brought together now-here
   and now-Kairos-into the dilated cerebral cortex ...

   The geodesic dome, of course, was Buckminster Fuller's inspiration. The
   light projections were chiefly Gerd Stern's, Gerd Stern of the USCO group,
   although Roy Seburn had already done a lot with them and Page Browning
   showed a talent that surprised everybody. But the magic dome, the new
   planet, was Kesey and the Pranksters. The idea went beyond what would
   later be known as mixed-media entertainment, now a standard practice in
   "psychedelic discotheques" and so forth. The Pranksters had the
   supra-medium, a fourth dimension-acid- Cosmo-All-one-Control-The-Movie-

   But why a dome? The answer to all the Prankster fantasies, public and
   private, the whole solution-they already found it; namely, the Hell's
   Angels party. That two-day rout hadn't been a party but a show. It had
   been more than a show even. It had been an incredible concentration of
   energy. Not only Pranksters, but people from all over, heads, non-heads,
   intellectuals, curiosity-seekers, even cops, had turned up and gotten
   swept up in the incredible energy of the thing. They had been in the
   Prankster movie. It was one show that hadn't been separated into
   entertainers and customers, with the customers buying a ticket and saying
   All right, now entertain me. At the Angels' party everybody got high
   together and everybody did his thing and entertained everybody else,
   Angels being Angels, Ginsberg being Ginsberg, Pranksters being Pranksters,
   and cops being cops. Even the cops did their thing, splashing those big
   lush evil revolving red turret lights off the dirt cliff and growling and
   baying and hassling cars.

                                      CAN

                                      YOU

                                    PASS THE

                                   ACID TEST?

   Anybody who could take LSD for the first time and go through all that
   without freaking out.. . Leary and Alpert preached "set and setting."
   Everything in taking LSD, in having a fruitful, freakout-free LSD
   experience, depended on set and setting. You should take it in some serene
   and attractive setting, a house or apartment decorated with objects of the
   honest sort, Turkoman tapestries, Greek goatskin rugs, Cost Plus blue
   jugs, soft light-not Japanese paper globe light, however, but untasselated
   Chinese textile shades-in short, an Uptown Bohemian country retreat of the
   $60,000-a-year sort, ideally, with Mozart's Requiem issuing with
   liturgical solemnity from the hi-fi. The "set" was the set of your mind.
   You should prepare for the experience by meditating upon the state of your
   being and deciding what you hope to discover or achieve on this voyage
   into the self. You should also have a guide who has taken LSD himself and
   is familiar with the various stages of the experience and whom you know
   and trust... and Fuck that! That only clamped the constipation of the
   past, the eternal lags, on something that should happen Now. Let the
   setting be as unserene and lurid as the Prankster arts can make it and let
   your set be only what is on your. . . brain, man, and let your guide, your
   trusty hand-holding, head-swaddling guide, be a bunch of Day-Glo crazies
   who have as one of their mottoes: "Never trust a Prankster." The Acid
   Tests would be like the Angels' party plus all the ideas that had gone
   into the Dome fantasy. Everybody would take acid, any time they wanted,
   six hours before the Test began or the moment they got there, at whatever
   point in the trip they wanted to enter the new planet. In any event, they
   would be on a new planet.

   The mysteries of the synch! Very strange ... the Acid Tests turned out, in
   fact, to be an art form foreseen in that strange book, Childhood's End, a
   form called "total identification": "The history of the cinema gave the
   clue to their actions. First, sound, then color, then stereoscopy, then
   Cinerama, had made the old moving pictures' more and more like reality
   itself. Where was the end of the story? Surely, the final stage would be
   reached when the audience forgot it was an audience, and became part of
   the action. To achieve this would involve stimulation of all the senses,
   and perhaps hypnosis as well... When the goal was attained, there would be
   an enormous enrichment of human experience. A man could become-for a
   while, at least,-any other person, and could take part in any conceivable
   adventure, real or imaginary.... And when the 'program' was over, he would
   have acquired a memory as vivid as any experience in his actual
   life-indeed, indistinguishable from reality itself."

   Too freaking true!

   THE FIRST ACID TEST ENDED UP MORE LIKE ONE OF THE OLD acid parties at La
   Honda, which is to say, a private affair, and mostly formless. It was
   meant to be public, but the Pranksters were not the world's greatest at
   the mechanics of things, like hiring a hall. The first one was going to be
   in Santa Cruz. But they couldn't hire a hall in time. They had to hold it
   out at Babbs's house, a place known as the Spread, just outside of Santa
   Cruz in a community known as Soquel. The Spread was like a rundown chicken
   farm. The wild vetch and dodder vines were gaining ground every minute, at
   least where the ground wasn't burnt off or beaten down into a clay muck.
   There were fat brown dogs and broken vehicles and rusted machines and
   rotting troughs and recapped tires and a little old farmhouse with
   linoleum floors and the kind of old greasy easy chairs that upholstery
   flies hover over in nappy clouds and move off about three-quarters of an
   inch when you wave your hand at them. But there were also wild Day-Glo
   creations on the walls and ceilings, by Babbs, and the place was private
   and tucked off by itself. In any case, they were stuck with the Spread.

   About all the advertising they could do was confined to the day of the
   Test itself. Norman Hartweg had painted a sign on some cardboard and
   tacked it onto some boards Babbs had used

   as cue signs in the movie, and put it up in the Hip Pocket Bookstore. Can
   YOU pass the Acid Test? The Hip Pocket Bookstore was a paperback bookstore
   that Hassler and Peter Demma, one of the Prankster outer circle, were
   running in Santa Cruz. They left word in the store that afternoon that it
   was going to be at Babbs's. A few local bohos saw it and came out, but
   mainly it was the Pranksters and their friends who showed up at the Spread
   that night, including a lot of the Berkeley crowd that had been coming to
   La Honda. Plus Allen Ginsberg and his entourage.

   It started off as a party, with some of the movie flashed on the walls,
   and lights, and tapes, and the Pranksters providing the music themselves,
   not to mention the LSD. The Pranksters' strange atonal Chinese music
   broadcast on all frequencies, `a la John Cage. It was mostly just another
   La Honda party-but then around 3 a.m. a thing happened ... The
   non-involved people, the people just there for the beano, the people who
   hadn't seen the Management, like the Berkeley people, they had all left by
   3 a.m. and the Test was down to some kind of core ... It ended up with
   Kesey on one side of Babbs's living room and Ginsberg on the other, with
   everybody else arranged around these two poles like on a magnet, all the
   Kesey people over toward him and all the Ginsberg people toward him-The
   super-West and the super-East-and the subject got to be Vietnam. Kesey
   gives his theory of whole multitudes of people joining hands in a clump
   and walking away from the war. Ginsberg said all these things, these wars,
   were the result of misunderstandings. Nobody who was doing the fighting
   ever wanted to be doing it, and if everybody could only sit around in a
   friendly way and talk it out, they could get to the root of their
   misunderstanding and settle it-and then from the rear of the Kesey
   contingent came the voice of the only man in the room who had been within
   a thousand miles of the war, Babbs, saying, "Yes, it's all so very
   obvious. "

   It's all so very obvious . . .

   How magical that comment seemed at that moment! The magical eighth hour of
   acid-how clear it all now was-Ginsberg had said it, and Babbs, the
   warrior, had certified it, and it had all built to this, and suddenly
   everything was so . . . very . . .clear . . .

   The Acid Test at the Spread was just a dry run, of course. It didn't
   really . .. reach out into the world ... But! soon ... the Rolling Stones,
   England's second hottest pop group, were coming to San Jose, 40 miles
   south of San Francisco, for a show in the Civic Auditorium on December 4.
   Kesey can see it all, having seen it before. He can see all the wound-up
   wired-up teeny freaks and assorted multitudes pouring out of the Cow
   Palace after the Beatles show that night, the fragmented pink-tentacled
   beast, pouring out still aquiver with ecstasy and jelly beans all cocked
   and aimless with no flow to go off in ... It is so very obvious.

   For three or four days the Pranksters searched for a hall in San Jose and
   couldn't come up with one-naturally-it really seemed natural and almost
   right that nothing should be definite until the last minute. All that was
   certain was that they would find one at the last minute. The Movie would
   create that much at least. And what if the multitudes didn't know where it
   was going to be until the last minute? Well, those who were meant to be
   there-those who were in the pudding-they would get there. You were either
   on the bus or off the bus, and that went for the whole world, even in San
   Jose, California. At the last minute Kesey talked a local boho figure
   known as Big Nig into letting them use his old hulk of a house.

   Kesey had hooked up with a rock 'n' roll band, The Grateful Dead, led by
   Jerry Garcia, the same dead-end kid who used to live in the Chateau in
   Palo Alto with Page Browning and other seeming no-counts, lumpenbeatniks,
   and you had to throw them out when they came over and tried to crash the
   parties on Perry Lane. Garcia remembered-how they came down and used to
   get booted out "by Kesey and the wine drinkers." The wine drinkers-the
   middle-class bohemians of Perry Lane. They both, Kesey and Garcia, had
   been heading into the pudding, from different directions, all that time,
   and now Garcia was a, yes, beautiful person, quiet, into the pudding, and
   a great guitar player. Garcia had first named his group The Warlocks,
   meaning sorcerers or wizards, and they had been eking by playing for the
   beer drinkers, at jazz joints and the like around Palo Alto. To the
   Warlocks, the beer drinker music, even when called jazz, was just square
   hip. They were on to that distinction, too. For Kesey-they could just
   play, do their thing.

   The Dead had an organist called Pig Pen, who had a Hammond electric organ,
   and they move the electric organ into Big Nig's ancient house, plus all of
   the Grateful Dead's electrified guitars and basses and the Pranksters'
   electrified guitars and basses and flutes and horns and the light machines
   and the movie projectors and the tapes and mikes and hi-fis, all of which
   pile up in insane coils of wires and gleams of stainless steel and winking
   amplifier dials before Big Nig's unbelieving eyes. His house is old and
   has wiring that would hardly hold a toaster. The Pranksters are primed in
   full Prankster regalia. Paul Foster has on his Importancy Coat and now has
   a huge head of curly hair, a great curly mustache pulling back into great
   curly mutton chops roaring off his face. Page Browning is the king of face
   painters. He becomes a full-fledged Devil with a bright orange face and
   his eyes become the centers of two great silver stars painted over the
   orange and his hair is silver with silver dust and he paints his lips
   silver with silver lipstick. This very night the Pranksters all sit down
   with oil pastel crayons and colored pens and at a wild rate start printing
   handbills on 8-1/2 X 11 paper saying Can YOU pass the Acid Test? and
   giving Big Nig's address. As the jellybean-cocked masses start pouring out
   of the Rolling Stones concert at the Civic Auditorium, the Pranksters
   charge in among them. Orange & silver Devil, wild man in a coat of
   buttons-Pranksters. Pranksters!-handing out the handbills with the
   challenge, like some sort of demons, warlocks verily, come to channel the
   wild pointless energy built up by the Rolling Stones inside.

   They come piling into Big Nig's, and suddenly acid and the Worldcraze were
   everywhere, the electric organ vibrating through every belly in the place,
   kids dancing not roc\ dances, not the frug and the-what?-swim, mother, but
   dancing ecstasy, leaping, dervishing, throwing their hands over their
   heads like Daddy Grace's own stroked-out inner courtiers-yes!-Roy
   Se-burn's lights washing past every head, Cassady rapping, Paul Foster
   handing people weird little things out of his Eccentric Bag, old whistles,
   tin crickets, burnt keys, spectral plastic handles. Everybody's eyes turn
   on like lightbulbs, fuses blow, blackness-wowwww!-the things that shake
   and vibrate and funnel and freak out in this blackness-and then somebody
   slaps new fuses in and the old hulk of a house shudders back, the wiring
   writhing and fragmenting like molting snakes, the organs vibro-massage the
   belly again, fuses blow, minds scream, heads explode, neighbors call the
   cops, 200,300,400 people from out there drawn into The Movie, into the
   edge of the pudding at least, a mass closer and higher than any mass in
   history, it seems most surely, and Kesey makes minute adjustment, small
   toggle switch here, lubricated with Vaseline No. 634-3 diluted with carbon
   tetrachloride, and they ripple, Major, ripple, but with meaning, 400 of
   the attuned multitude headed toward the pudding, the first mass acid
   experience, the dawn of the Psychedelic, the Flower Generation and all the
   rest of it, and Big Nig wants the rent.

   "How you holding?"

   How you holding-

   "I mean, like, you know," says Big Nig to Garcia. "I didn't charge Kesey
   nothing to use this place, like free?, you know? and the procedure now is
   that every cat here contributes, man, to help out with the rent." With the
   rent-

   "Yeah, I mean, like"-says Big Nig. Big Nig stares at Garcia with the
   deepest look of hip spade soul authority you can imagine, and nice and
   officious, too-

   Yeah, I mean, life-Garcia, for his part, however, doesn't know which
   bursts out first, the music or the orange laugh. Out the edges of his eyes
   he can see his own black hair framing his face-it is so long, to the
   shoulders, and springs out like a Sudanese soldier's-and then big Nig's
   big earnest black face right in front of him flapping and washing
   comically out into the glistening acid-glee red sea of faces out beyond
   them both in the galactic red lakes on the walls-

   "Yeah, I mean, like, for the rent, man," says Big Nig, "you already blown
   six fuses."

   Blown! Six fuses! Garcia sticks his hand into his electric guitar and the
   notes come out like a huge orange laugh all blown fuses electric spark
   leaps in colors upon the glistening sea of faces. It's a freaking laugh
   and a half. A new star is being born, like a light-bulb in a womb, and Big
   Nig wants the rent-a new star being born, a new planet forming, Ahura
   Mazda blazing in the world womb, here before our very eyes-and Big Nig,
   the poor pathetic spade, wants his rent.

   A freaking odd thought, that one. A big funky spade looking pathetic and
   square. For twenty years in the hip life, Negroes never even looked
   square. They were the archetypical soul figures. But what is Soul, or
   Funky, or Cool, or Baby-in the new world of the ecstasy, the All-one .. .
   the kairos....

   IF ONLY THERE WERE THE PERFECT PLACE, WHICH WOULD BE a place big enough
   for the multitudes and isolated enough to avoid the cops, with their
   curfews and eternal hassling. Shortly after that they found the perfect
   place, by acci-

   By accident, Mahavira?

   The third Acid Test was scheduled for Stinson Beach, 15 miles north of San
   Francisco. Stinson Beach was already a gathering place for local heads.
   You could live all winter in little beach cottages there for next to
   nothing. There was a nice solid brick recreation hall on the beach, all
   very nice-but at the last minute that whole deal fell through, and they
   shifted to Muir Beach, a few miles south. The handbills were already out,
   all over the head sections of San Francisco, Can YOU pass the Acid Test,
   advertising Cassady & Ann Murphy Vaudeville and celebrities who might be
   there, which included anybody who happened to be in town, or might make it
   to town, the Fugs, Ginsberg, Roland Kirk. There were always some nice
   chiffon subjunctives and the future conditionals in the Prankster handbill
   rhetoric, but who was to deny who might be drawn into the Movie . ..

   Anyway, at the last minute they headed for Muir Beach instead. The fact
   that many people wouldn't know about the change and would go to Stinson
   Beach and merely freeze in the darkness and never find the right
   place-somehow that didn't even seem distressing. It was part of some
   strange analogical order of the universe. Norman Hartweg hooked down his
   LSD-it was in the acid gas capsules that night-and thought of Gurdjieff.
   Gurdjieff wouldn't announce a meeting until the last minute. We're gonna
   get together tonight. The people that got there, got there; and there was
   message in that alone. Which was, of course: you're either on the bus or
   off the bus.

   Those who were on the bus, even if they weren't Pranksters, like Marshall
   Efron, the round Mercury of Hip California, or the Hell's Angels... all
   found it. The cops, however, never did. They were apparently thrown off by
   the Stinson Beach handbills.

   Muir Beach had a big log-cabin-style lodge for dances, banquets, and the
   like. The lodge was stilted up out in a waste of frigid marsh grass. A big
   empty nighttime beach in winter. Some little log tourist cabins with blue
   doors on either side, all empty. The lodge had three big rooms and was
   about 100 feet long, all logs and rafters and exposed beams, a tight ship
   of dark wood and Roughing It. The Grateful Dead piled in with their
   equipment and the Pranksters with theirs, which now included a Hammond
   electric organ for Gretch and a great strobe light.

   The strobe! The strobe, or stroboscope, was originally an instrument for
   studying motion, like the way a man's legs move when he is running. In a
   darkened chamber, for example, you aim a bright light, flashing on and
   off, at the runner's legs as he runs. The light flashes on and off very
   rapidly, maybe three times as fast as a normal heartbeat. Every time the
   light flashes on, you see a new stage in the movement of the runner's
   legs. The successive images tend to freeze in your mind, because the light
   flashes off before the usual optical blur of the motion can hit you. The
   strobe has certain magical properties in the world of the acid heads. At
   certain speeds stroboscopic lights are so synched in with the pattern of
   brain waves that they can throw epileptics into a seizure. Heads
   discovered that strobes could project them into many of the sensations of
   an LSD experience without taking LSD. The strobe!

   To people standing under the mighty strobe everything seemed to fragment.
   Ecstatic dancers-their hands flew off their arms, frozen in the air-their
   glistening faces came apart-a gleaming ellipse of teeth here, a pair of
   buffered highlit cheekbones there-all flacking and fragmenting into images
   as in an old flicker movie-a man in slices!-all of history pinned up on a
   butterfly board; the experience, of course. The strobe, the projectors,
   the mikes, the tapes, the amplifiers, the variable lag Ampex-it was all
   set up in a coiling gleaming clump in the Lincoln Log lodge, the communal
   clump, Babbs working over the dials, talking into the microphones to test
   them. Heads beginning to pour in. Marshall Efron and Norman, Norman
   already fairly zonked ... Then in comes Kesey, through the main door-

   Everyone watches. His face is set, his head cocked slightly. He is going
   to do something; everyone watches, because this seems terribly important.
   Drawn in right away by the charismatic vacuum cleaner, they are. Kesey
   heads for the control center, saying nothing to anyone, reaches into the
   galaxy of dials, makes ... a single minute adjustment... yes! one toggle
   switch, double-pole, single-throw, double-break, in the allegory of
   Control. . .

   Babbs is there, bombed, but setting up the intricate glistening coils of
   the tapes and projectors and the rest of it. Each of the Pranksters,
   bombed, has some fairly exacting task to do. Norman is staring at the
   dials-and he can't even see the numbers, he is so bombed, the numbers are
   wriggling off like huge luminous parasites under a
   microscope-but--function under acid. Babbs says, "One reason we're doing
   this is to learn how to function on acid." Of course! Prepare for the
   Day-when multitudes, millions, civilizations are on acid, seeking satori,
   it is coming, the wave is spreading.

   The heads are all sitting around on the floor, about 300 of them. Into the
   maelstrom! Yes. At Big Nig's in San Jose, a lot of the kids the Pranksters
   had corralled coming out of the Rolling Stones show did not take LSD that
   night, although there were enough heads at Big Nig's stoned on various
   things to create that sympathetic vibration known as the "contact high."
   But this is different. Practically everybody who has found the place,
   after the switch from Stinson Beach, is far enough into the thing to know
   what the "acid" in the Acid Test means. A high percentage took LSD about
   four hours ago, rode out the first rush and are ready ... now to groove
   ... The two projectors shine forth with The Movie. The bus and the
   Pranksters start rolling over the walls of the lodge, Babbs and Kesey
   rapping on about it, the Bus lumping huge and vibrating and bouncing in
   great swells of heads and color-Norman, zonked, sitting on the floor, is
   half frightened, half ecstatic, although something in the back of his mind
   recognizes this as his Acid Test pattern, to sit back and watch, holding
   on through the rush, until 3 or 4 a.m., in the magic hours, and then
   dance-but so much of a rush this time! The Movie and Roy Seburn's light
   machine pitching the inter-galactic red science-fiction seas to all
   corners of the lodge, oil and water and food coloring pressed between
   plates of glass and projected in vast size so that the very ooze of
   cellular Creation seems to ectoplast into the ethers and then the Dead
   coming in with their immense submarine vibrato vibrating, garanging, from
   the Aleutian rocks to the baja griffin cliffs of the Gulf of California.
   The Dead's weird sound! agony-in-ecstasis! submarine somehow, turbid half
   the time, tremendously loud but like sitting under a waterfall, at the
   same time full of sort of ghoul-show vibrato sounds as if each string on
   their electric guitars is half a block long and twanging in a room full of
   natural gas, not to mention their great Hammond electric organ, which
   sounds like a movie house Wurlitzer, a diathermy machine, a Citizens' Band
   radio and an Auto-Grind garbage truck at 4 a.m., all coming over the same
   frequency ... Then suddenly another movie

   The Frogman

   Babbs and Gretch and Hagen made it down in Santa Cruz, the story of Babbs
   the Frogman, arising from the Pacific in black neopreme Frogman suit from
   flippers to insect goggles, the pranking monster, falling in love with the
   Princess, Gretch, with floods of frames from elsewhere-the Bus
   Movie?-brittering in stroboscopically Frogman woos her and wins her and
   loses her to the Pacific Chohans in submarinal projection

   Babbs! Gretch!

   Norman has never seen a movie while under acid before and it deepens,
   deepens, deepens in perspective, this movie, the most 3-D movie ever made,
   until they are standing right before him, their very neopreme fairy tails
   and the Pacific is so far in the distance and black out beyond the marshes
   around the Muir Beach lodge until Babbs and Gretch are now in the room in
   the flesh in two separate spots, here before me on the beach and over here
   in this very room in this very lodge on the beach, Babbs at the microphone
   and Gretch nearby at the new Hammond organ-such synch! that they should
   narrate and orchestrate their own lives like this, in variable lag, layer
   upon layer of variable lags

   Heeeeeeeee into the whirlpool who should appear but Owsley. Owsley, done
   up in his $600 head costume, has emerged from his subterrain of espionage
   and paranoia to come to see the Prankster experiment for himself, and in
   the middle of the giddy contagion he takes LSD. They never saw him take it
   before. He takes the LSD and

   Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrroil the whirlpool picks him up and spins him down
   into the stroboscope stereoptic prankster panopticon in full variable lag

   Such creatures

   Hell's Angels come reeling in, shrieking Day-Glo, then clumping together
   on the floor under the black light and then most gentle Buddha blissly
   passing around among themselves various glittering Angel esoterica,
   chains, Iron Crosses, knives, buttons, coins, keys, wrenches, spark plugs,
   grokking over these arcana winking in the Day-Glo. Orange & Silver devil
   gliding through the dancers grinning his Zea-lot grin in every face, and
   Kesey crouched amid the gleaming coils, at the

   Controls

   Kesey looks out upon the stroboscopic whirlpool-the dancers! flung and
   flinging! in ecstasis!  gyrating! levitating! men in slices! in ping-pong
   balls! in the creamy bare essence and it reaches a

   Synch

   he never saw before. Heads from all over the acid world out here and all
   whirling into the pudding. Now let a man see what

   Control

   is. Kesey mans the strobe and a twist of the mercury lever

   Up

   and they all speed up

   Now

   the whole whirlpool, so far into it, they are. Faster they dance, hands
   thrown up off their arms like confetti in the strobe flashing, blissful
   faces falling apart and being exchanged, for I am you and you are me in
   Cosmo's Tasmanian deviltry. Turn it

   Down

   and they slow down-or We turn down-It-Cosmo-turns down, still in perfect
   synch, one brain, one energy, a single flow of intersubjectivity. It is
   possible this alchemy so dreamed of by all the heads. It is happening
   before them

   Control

   curiously, after the first rush at the acid test, there would be long
   intervals of the most exquisite boredom. Exquisite, because it was so
   unsuspected after the general frenzy. Nothing would happen, at least not
   in the usual sense. Those who were ... not on the bus... would come to the
   realization that there was no schedule. The Grateful Dead did not play in
   sets; no eight numbers to a set, then a twenty-five-minute break, and so
   on, four or five sets and then the close-out. The Dead might play one
   number for five minutes or thirty minutes. Who kept time? Who could keep
   time, with history cut up in slices. The Dead could get just as stoned as
   anyone else. The... non-attuned would look about and here would be all
   manner of heads, including those running the show, the Pranksters, stroked
   out against the walls like slices of Jello. Waiting; with nobody looking
   very likely to start it back up. Those who didn't care to wait would tend
   to drift off, stoned or otherwise, and the Test would settle down to the
   pudding. The Prankster band started the strange Chinese cacophony of its
   own, with Gretch wailing on the new electric organ. Norman got up and
   danced, it being that time. He even fooled about a bit with a little light
   projection thing of his own, although he didn't think it was good enough,
   but the magic hours were coming on like electric velvet. Kesey spoke
   softly over the microphone. They were into the still of the hurricane, the
   pudding.

   AT DAWN - A FREAKING COLD LIGHT ON THE MARSH GRASS AND the beach. A purple
   shadow all over the ocean like one huge stone-cold bruise. Suddenly the
   main door bursts open and it's Owsley.

   Owsley is lurching and groping and screaming

   "Survival!"

   It comes out like a steam whistle forced out of a constricted little
   opening

   "Survival!"

   Owsley, the Acid King, in his $600 head outfit, groping through the blue
   bruise dawn with his eyes like disaster craters, hissing

   "Survival!"

   The sight of Kesey apparently hits him with a surge of adrenaline,
   however, because he recovers his voice and starts in on Kesey:

   "Kesey!"

   The gist of it is that Kesey can't do this again. This is the end. The
   Acid Tests are over. Kesey is a maniac and the Tests are maniacal and the
   roof is falling in. Taking LSD in a monster group like this gets too many
   forces going, too much amok energy, causing very freaky and destructive
   things to happen, and so on. It's his acid and he says this is the end.
   None of them can figure out precisely what he is saying. Just that he has
   flipped and Kesey did it.

   Little by little, they piece it together. He has had quite a trip for
   himself on his own LSD, has Owsley. It seems that Owsley took the LSD, a
   good dose, apparently, and the strobe light and the incredible layers of
   variable lag began rocking and rippling him and it threw him into a time
   warp, or parallel time dimension. The heads were always talking about such
   things. They could cite some serious thinkers, scientists even, such as C.
   D. Broad and his theory of a second temporal dimension-"events which are
   separated by a temporal gap in one dimension may be adjoined without any
   gap in the other, just as two points in the earth's surface which differ
   in longitude may be identical in latitude"-or J. W. Dunne's theory of
   serialism, or infinite regress-or Maurice Maeterlinck. The heads were
   always talking about such things and Owsley was primed for it. Then he got
   high. Then he got caught in the whirlpool, spun out of his gourd by all
   the special effects of the Pranksters' variable lag devices-and the legend
   of the trip he took eventually was told as follows:

   Back he went into the eighteenth century, Count Cagliostro! no longer
   plain Giuseppe Balsamo of Palermo, the Oakland of the Mediterranean, but
   the good Count, alchemist, seer, magician, master of precognition,
   forecaster of lotteries, alchemical creator, from out of base elements
   of... this diamond, greatest and most dazzling in history-here, Cardinal
   Louis de Rohan-but!-persecuted as a thaumaturge-thrust into this spinning
   black donjon, the Bastille, seeping with lurid water and carbonated moss
   and twitching dismembered rats, anatomized in the flashing light of the
   diamond they wouldn't believe, a rat shank here, a rat metacarpal there,
   rat teeth, rat eyes, rat tails leaping and frozen in the air like city
   lights-that noise-a mob in the streets-either salvation-or-the Bastille
   begins to disintegrate into absorbent felt cubes-

   -and so on. The world began fragmenting on him. It began coming totally to
   pieces, breaking up into component parts, and he wasn't even back in the
   twentieth century yet, he was trapped-where?-Paris in 1786? ... The whole
   world was coming to pieces molecule by molecule now and swimming like
   grease bubbles in a cup of coffee, disappearing into the inter-galactic
   ooze and gasses all around-including his own body. He lost his skin, his
   skeleton, his pulmonary veins-sneaking out into the ooze like eels, they
   are, reeking phosphorus, his neural ganglia-unraveling like hot worms and
   wiggling down the galactic drain, his whole substance dissolving into
   gaseous nothingness until finally he was down to one cell. One human cell:
   his; that was all that was left of the entire known world, and if he lost
   control of that one cell, there would be nothing left. The world would be,
   like, over. He has to rebuild himself and the entire world from that one
   cell with a gigantic act of will-too overwhelming. Where does a man start?
   With California Route 1 so he can get out of here in his car? or will it
   turn out to be merely the filthy Rue Ventru with the Bastille mobs
   waiting? or start with the car? the differential? how do they make the
   bastards? or the beach? all those freaking grains of sand? the marsh
   grass? the tourist cabins? got to put every blue door back? or the ocean?
   or leave it dry? save making all those filthy blind bathosphere black
   animals down there ... or the sky? how far does it go? the Big Dipper? the
   Ursa Minor? the Delphinium? suppose it is really infinite concentric
   spheres of crystal making infinite gelatinous submarinal vibrations? the
   Dead? the Pranksters? Kesey, Kesey's out for good, Kesey and the
   bathosphere brutes-but with a superheroic effort he begins. But by the
   time he gets himself remade, it is too much. It is overwhelming. He makes
   his car. He makes the parking lot and the beginning of the road out. He'll
   make the rest of it as he goes along. Freak it! Split! Leave the rest of
   the known world to its own devices, out in the gasses. He jumped into the
   car and gunned off; and smashed it into a tree. A tree he hadn't even put
   back  yet. But the crash somehow pops the whole world back. There it is;
   back from the fat-bubbling ooze. The car is smashed, but he has survived.
   Survived!

   Survival!

   and he plunges into the lodge to seek out the maniac Kesey. That sombitch
   has prolly popped back, too.

                                    chapter

                                      XIX

                               The Trips Festival

   Owsley's freakout! owsley became obsessed with it himself. Whenever the
   subject was the LSD experience- which it was most of the time around
   Owsley-he would recount his experience at Muir Beach. It seemed to horrify
   and intrigue him at the same time-such morbid but wonderful details.
   Everyone listens ... can such things be? In any case, it sounded like
   Owsley thought Kesey was a demon and he was going to cut off their LSD
   supply.

   Richard Alpert was also unhappy with the Acid Tests. Alpert, like Timothy
   Leary, had sacrificed his academic career as a psychologist for the sake
   of the psychedelic movement. It was hard enough to keep the straight
   multitudes from going hysterical over the subject of LSD even in the best
   of circumstances-let alone when it was used for manic screaming orgies in
   public places. Among the heads who leaned toward Leary and Alpert, it was
   hard to even freaking believe that the Pranksters were pulling a freaking
   prank like this. Any moment they were expecting them to explode into some
   sort of debacle, some sort of mass freakout, that the press could seize on
   and bury the psychedelic movement forever. The police watched them
   closely, but there was very little they could do about it, except for an
   occasional marijuana bust, since there was no law against LSD at the time.
   The Pranksters went on to hold Tests in Palo Alto, Portland, Oregon, two
   in San Francisco, four in and around Los Angeles-and three in Mexico-and
   no laws broken here, Lieutenant-only every law of God and man-In short, a
   goddamn outrage, and we're powerless-

   The Acid Tests were one of those outrages, one of those scandals, that
   create a new style or a new world view. Everyone clucks, fumes, grinds
   their teeth over the bad taste, the bad morals, the insolence, the
   vulgarity, the childishness, the lunacy, the cruelty, the
   irresponsibility, the fraudulence and, in fact, gets worked up into such a
   state of excitement, such an epitasis, such a slaver, they can't turn it
   loose. It becomes a perfect obsession. And now they'll show you how it
   should have been done.

   The Acid Tests were the epoch of the psychedelic style and practically
   everything that has gone into it. I don't mean merely that the Pranksters
   did it first but, rather, that it all came straight out of the Acid Tests
   in a direct line leading to the Trips Festival of January 1966. That
   brought the whole thing full out in the open. "Mixed media"
   entertainment-this came straight out of the Acid Tests' combination of
   light and movie projections, strobes, tapes, rock 'n' roll, black light.
   "Acid rock"-the sound of the Beatles' Sergeant Pepper album and the
   high-vibrato electronic sounds of the Jefferson Airplane, the Mothers of
   Invention and many other groups-the mothers of it all were the Grateful
   Dead at the Acid Tests. The Dead were the audio counterpart of Roy
   Seburn's light projections. Owsley was responsible for some of this,
   indirectly. Owsley had snapped back from his great Freakout and started
   pouring money into the Grateful Dead and, thereby, the Tests. Maybe he
   figured the Tests were the wave of the future, whether he had freaked out
   or not. Maybe he thought "acid rock" was the sound of the future and he
   would become a kind of Brian Epstein for the Grateful Dead. I don't know.
   In any case, he started buying the Dead equipment such as no rock 'n' roll
   band ever had before, the Beatles included, all manner of tuners,
   amplifiers, receivers, loudspeakers, microphones, cartridges, tapes,
   theater horns, booms, lights, turntables, instruments, mixers, muters,
   servile mesochroics, whatever was on the market. The sound went down so
   many microphones and hooked through so many mixers and variable lags and
   blew up in so many amplifiers and roiled around in so many speakers and
   fed back down so many microphones, it came on like a chemical refinery.
   There was something wholly new and deliriously weird in the Dead's sound,
   and practically everything new in rock 'n' roll, rock jazz I have heard it
   called, came out of it.

   Even details like psychedelic poster art, the quasi-art nouveau swirls of
   lettering, design and vibrating colors, electro-pastels and spectral
   Day-Glo, came out of the Acid Tests. Later other impresarios and
   performers would recreate the Prankster styles with a sophistication the
   Pranksters never dreamed of. Art is not eternal, boys. The posters became
   works of art in the accepted cultural tradition. Others would even play
   the Dead's sound more successfully, commercially, anyway, than the Dead.
   Others would do the mixed-media thing until it was pure ambrosial candy
   for the brain with creamy filling every time. To which Kesey would say:
   "They know where it is, but they don't know what it is."

   IT WAS ACTUALLY STEWART BRAND WHO THOUGHT UP THE great Trips Festival of
   January 1966. Brand and a San Francisco artist, Ramon Sender. Brand was 27
   and an ex-biologist who had run across the Indian peyote cults in Arizona
   and New Mexico. Brand founded an organization called America Needs
   Indians. And then one day he took some LSD, right after an Explorer
   satellite went up to photograph the earth, and as the old synapses began
   rapping around inside his skull at 5,000 thoughts per second, he was
   struck with one of those questions that inflame men's brains: Why Haven't
   We Seen a Photograph of the Whole Earth Yet?-and he drove across America
   from Berkeley, California, to 116th Street, New York City, selling buttons
   with that legend on them to Leftists, Rightists, Fundamentalists,
   Theosophists, malcontents, anyone with the health or stealth of paranoia
   or the put-on in their souls ...

   He and his friend Sender got the idea of pulling together all the new
   forms of expression that were kicking around in the hip world at that
   moment and having a Super Acid Test out in the open. Hire a hall and call
   in the multitudes. They found an impresario for the thing, Bill Graham, a
   New Yorker who had a lot of cachet in the hip world of San Francisco as a
   member of the San Francisco Mime Troupe, which used to get busted for
   putting on political dumb shows in the park, that kind of thing. The Trips
   Festival was set for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights, January 21-23,
   at the Longshoremen's Hall in San Francisco. The Trips Festival was billed
   as a big celebration that was going to simulate an LSD experience, minus
   the LSD, using light effects and music, mainly. The big night, Saturday
   night, was going to be called The Acid Test, featuring Ken Kesey and the
   Merry Pranksters.

   Kesey and the Pranksters were primed for the Festival. Even Mountain Girl
   was on hand. She had wrestled the thing out in her mind and was back on
   the bus. The Pranksters had just held an Acid Test at the Fillmore
   Auditorium, a big ballroom in the middle of one of San Francisco's big
   Negro slums, the Fillmore district. It was a wild night. Hundreds of heads
   and bohos from all over the Bay area turned out, zonked to the eyeballs.
   Paul Krassner was back in town, and he heard the word that was out on . ..
   The Scene. Everybody would be "dropping acid" about 5 or 6 p.m. to get
   ready for the Acid Test to begin that night at nine o'clock at the
   Fillmore Auditorium. Krassner arrives and- shit!-he sees:

   ... a ballroom surrealistically seething with a couple of thousand bodies
   stoned out of their everlovin bruces in crazy costumes and obscene makeup
   with a raucous rock 'n roll band and stroboscope lights and a thunder
   machine and balloons and heads and streamers and electronic equipment and
   the back of a guy's coat proclaiming Please don't believe in magic to a
   girl dancing with 4-inch eyelashes so that even the goddamn Pinkerton
   Guards were contact high.

   Kesey asks him to take the microphone and contribute to a running
   commentary on the scene. "All I know," he announces into the din, "is that
   if I were a cop and I came in here, I wouldn't know where to begin."

   Well, the cops came in, and they didn't know where to begin. They came in
   to close the Test down at 2 a.m. in keeping with a local ordinance and the
   whole thing was at its maddest height. Mountain Girl had hold of a
   microphone and was shrieking encouragement to the flailing dancers. Babbs
   was beaming spotlights at heads who were veering around bombed and asking
   them spectral questions over another microphone-Say there, what's your
   trouble-have you l-o-s-t y-o-u-r mi-i-i-i-i-i-i-nd!  Page Browning was
   grinning Zea-lot. The cops started shouting for them to close down but
   couldn't make themselves heard and started pulling plugs out, microphone
   plugs, loudspeaker plugs, strobe plugs, amplifier plugs-but there were so
   many goddamn plugs, the most monumental snake pit of wires and plugs in
   history, and as fast as they would pull eight plugs out, Mountain Girl
   would put ten plugs back in, and finally Mountain Girl had a microphone up
   on the balcony somewhere and was screaming instructions to the dancers and
   the cops-louder music, more wine-and they couldn't find her. Finally they
   ordered the Pranksters to start clearing the place out, which they did,
   except for Babbs, who sat down in a chair and wouldn't budge. We said get
   busy, said the cops.

   "I don't have to," said Babbs. "I'm the boss here. They're working for me.
   "

   Yeah?-and one of the cops grabs Babbs by a luminous vest he has on,
   succeeding only in separating Babbs from the vest. Babbs grinning
   maniacally but suddenly looming most large and fierce.

   "You're under arrest!"

   "For what?"

   "Resistin'."

   "Resistin' what?"

   "You gonna come quietly or do we have to take you?"

   "Either way you want it," says Babbs, grinning in the most frightening
   manner now, like the next step is eight karate chops to the gizzards and
   giblets. Suddenly it is a Mexican standoff-with both sides glaring but
   nobody swinging a punch yet. It is a grand hassle, of course. At the last
   minute a couple of Kesey's lawyers arrive on the scene and cool everything
   down and talk the cops out of it and Babbs out of it and it all rumbles
   away in the valley as part of the Welthassle.

   THE LAWYERS - YES. KESEY'S ORIGINAL MARIJUANA CHARGE, on the big arrest at
   La Honda, had been ricocheting around in the San Mateo County court system
   for nine months. Kesey's lawyers were attacking the warrant that enabled
   the various constables to make the raid. The case had started with a Grand
   Jury hearing, which is of course a secret procedure. The County claimed it
   had all sorts of evidence to the effect that Kesey and the Pranksters had
   been giving dope to minors. Kesey's lawyers were trying to get the whole
   case thrown out on the grounds that the original warrant for the raid was
   fraudulent. This didn't work, and Kesey now had the choice of facing trial
   and a lot of lurid testimony or waiving open trial and letting a judge
   decide the case on the basis of the transcript of the Grand Jury
   proceedings. It was finally arranged that Kesey would let the judge do it.
   He would most likely be getting a light sentence. Even after that he could
   still appeal the case on the grounds that the warrant had been trumped up.
   This whole thing with the judge was the equivalent, in a roundabout way,
   of pleading no contest. On January 17, 1966, four days before the Trips
   Festival, the judge duly found Kesey guilty and sentenced him to six
   months on a work farm and three years on probation. This was about what
   his lawyers expected. It wasn't so bad. The work farm was right near La
   Honda, ironically enough, and the prisoners did a lot of their work
   clearing out a stretch of forest back of Kesey's place. There was
   something very funny about that. Lime-light bowers for the straight
   multitudes. There was more irony. McMurphy, in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
   Nest, started his adventures with a six-month stretch on a work farm.
   Kesey had been a McMurphy on the outside for four years. Now maybe he
   would be a McMurphy on the inside, for real. Maybe ... anyway it was far
   from the goddamn end of the world. Then an uncool thing happened.

   THE NIGHT OF JANUARY 19, TWO NIGHTS BEFORE THE TRIPS Festival, Kesey,
   Mountain Girl, and some of the Pranksters went over to Stewart Brand's
   apartment, in North Beach, San Francisco, to make plans for the Trips
   Festival. Sometime after midnight Kesey and Mountain Girl went up on the
   roof on top of the building and spread out an old blue pad that had been
   in the back of somebody's station wagon on the gravel up there and
   stretched out on the pad, grooving on the peaceful debris of North Beach.
   It's nice and homey boho quaint, North Beach. Slums with a view. Out there
   the lights of the bay and the fishing boats and the honky-tonks and more
   lights climbing up the hills of San Francisco and nearer, all the asphalt
   squares of the other rooftops, squares and levels and ladders-grooving on
   the design, which is nice and peaceful and a little arty-looking, but that
   is North Beach. Mountain Girl all dark brown hair and big brown eyes,
   coming on ornery and fun-loving-it occurs to Kesey-rather like the eyes of
   an Irish setter pup just turning from awkward carefree frolic to the task
   of devotion.

   Mountain Girl is being enthusiastic about the Trips Festival. "With that
   big new speaker," she says, "we'll be able to wire that place so you can
   hear a flea fart!"

   Awkward carefree frolic to the task of-Kesey is feeling old. Once a stud
   so gorged with muscle tone-his face feels lopsided with the strain, of...
   the eternal hassling, the lawyering, the legally sanctioned lying on all
   sides, politicking, sucking up, getting lectured at, cranking on the old
   lopsided diplomatic smile ...

   "-hear a flea fart!" "Hasn't happened yet," says Kesey.

   "With this many days to set it up? Always before we were in the hall that
   night and maybe set up before we finished in the morning."

   And so forth and so on-Kesey and Mountain Girl lie on their stomachs with
   their chins in their hands, gazing down four stories to the alley below
   and occasionally scraping gravel off the rooftop and tossing it down ...

   ... yes... ummm ... at 1:53 a.m. the cops of the 19th Precinct got a call
   from a woman at 18 Margrave Place saying some drunken tormentors or
   something were throwing rocks at her window. Shortly after 2 a.m. a police
   car pulls into the alley. So Kesey and Mountain Girl groove on that. Yup,
   a police car right down below, police car come here. A red light on a
   hillside drive about 50 yards away blinks. A red light blinks and a police
   car tools in the alley. Ah, always the synch, friends. The cops are coming
   in this building. Wonder on earth what for. Do I learn anything? Or once
   again lie loaded and disbelieving as two cops climb five stories to drag
   me to the cooler.... Oh, the logic of the groove and the synch. Kesey and
   Mountain Girl see it all at once, now, so clearly. It is so very obvious
   that it fascinates. They see it all, grok it all-Scram, split, run, flee,
   hide, vanish, disintegrate-the red alert is so very clear, it blinks and
   blinks, red, nothing, red, nothing, red, nothing, red, nothing, and yet
   move? and miss it all? turning so slow in the interferrometric synch? It
   is like a weird time he was in Olympic wrestling eliminations, in 1960, in
   the San Francisco Olympic Club, first round against a hulking stud, and he
   took a couple of vitamins before the fray, revved up, revved up, not
   doped, oh mom&dad&buddy&sis&dear-but-square-ones, all Olympian athletes
   are doped, force-fed pill-heads, see them lead them, all gorged with
   glistening muscle veins and crewcut and led to the training table and by
   every plate a lineup of capsules like the wineglasses at the gourmet
   dinner, capsules for iron, capsules for calcium, capsules to make you
   squeeze your colon and flex your heart, capsules of B12 mighty as pure
   amphetamine turn your blood vessels into black snakes, capsules to make
   you long and brute in the teeth, make you clean & jerk in the arms, mad
   ape in the neck, sharp in the tusk, panther in the solar plexus lineup of
   crewcut stud bulls concocted out of chemicals force-fed every day at every
   plate-revved up, revved up, revved up waiting for the referee to snap his
   hand up in mid-air to start the match, snap... and it is so very
   fascinating ... he is like a motor running at top speed with the clutch in
   ... it is intriguing, not intimidating, the way this great stud grabs him
   above the knee with his huge hand and starts pulling down-Kesey is two
   people, revved up here on the mat and revved up here in the ethers like an
   astral body, watching-interesting!-no man could be as strong as this guy
   here and execute a takedown by pulling downward on the knee-no danger,
   friends, just fascination-and so the guy won a trophy for the fastest pin
   of the tourney, while the motor revved in synch with a different bummer-

   -fascinating!-so-

   -out the scroffy arty rooftop door come two cops, Officers Fred Pardella
   and Thomas L. O'Donnell of the 19th Precinct, by designation-

   What happened next became the subject of two trials in San Francisco,
   later, many fugitive months later, both ending in hung juries, the second
   one 11 to 1 against Kesey. According to Officers Pardella and O'Donnell,
   they found the suspects Kesey and the Adams girl and a plastic bag
   containing a quantity of brownish vegetation. Whereupon Officer O'Donnell
   sought to collect the evidence, and Kesey wrestled him for it, throwing
   the bag onto an adjoining arty rectangle rooftop and very nearly Pardella
   along with it, whereupon Officer O'Donnell drew his gun and brought both
   Kesey and the girl into custody. The plastic bag, retrieved, contained
   3.54 grams of marijuana.

   THIS WAS A BEAUTIFUL MESS AND NO TWO WAYS ABOUT IT. A second offense for
   possession of marijuana carried an automatic five-year sentence with no
   possibility of parole. At the very least he stood to get the full
   three-year sentence in San Mateo County now, as one of the judge's
   conditions had been that he no longer associate with the Pranksters.
   Mountain Girl was ready to take the whole rap herself. "We were just tying
   it off," she told the press. "He wasn't supposed to hang around with any
   of us wild, giddy people any more. This was the last time we were gonna
   see him." Well... she tried. Kesey's probation officer in San Mateo County
   advised him for godsake stay away from the Trips Festival or he was in for
   it, but the whole thing was miles beyond in-for-it, out towards old Edge
   City, in fact.

   Kesey left Municipal Court in San Francisco on January 20 with Mountain
   Girl and Stewart Brand and onto the whole bus full of Pranksters to roll
   through San Francisco advertising the Trips Festival. They got out at
   Union Square. Kesey wore a pair of white Levi's with the backsides
   emblazoned with HOT on the left side and COLD on the right and TIBET in
   the middle.- and a pair of sky-blue boots. They all played Ron Boisie's
   Thunder Machine for loon vibrations in Union Square in the fibrillateing
   heart of San Francisco.

   If nothing else, Kesey's second arrest was great publicity for the Trips
   Festival. It was all over San Francisco newspapers. In the hip,
   intellectual, and even social worlds of San Francisco, the Trips Festival
   notion was spreading like a fever. The dread drug LSD. Acid heads. An LSD
   experience without the LSD, it was being billed as-moreover, people
   actually believed it. But mainly the idea of a new life style was making
   itself felt. Do you suppose this is the-new wave... ?

   And you buy y'r ticket,  f'r chrissake-an absurd thought to Norman
   Hartweg-and we've got a promoter-all absurd, but the thousands pour into
   the Longshoremen's Hall for the Trips Festival, thousands even the first
   night, which was mostly Indian night, a weird thing put on by Brand's
   America Needs Indians, but now on Saturday evening the huge crush hits for
   the Acid Test. Norman is absolutely zonked on acid-and look at the freaks
   running in here. Norman is not the only one. "An LSD experience without
   LSD"-that was a laugh. In fact, the heads are pouring in by the hundreds,
   bombed out of their gourds, hundreds of heads coming out into the absolute
   open for the first time. It is like the time the Pranksters went to the
   Beatles concert in full costume, looking so bizarre and so totally smashed
   that no one could believe they were. Nobody would risk it in public like
   this. Well, the kids are just having an LSD experience without LSD, that's
   all, and this is what it looks like. A hulking crazed whirlpool. That's
   nice. Lights and movies sweeping around the hall; five movie projectors
   going and God knows how many light machines, interferrometrics, the
   intergalactic science-fiction seas all over the walls, loudspeakers
   studding the hall all the way around like flaming chandeliers, strobes
   exploding, black lights with Day-Glo objects under them and Day-Glo paint
   to play with, street lights at every entrance flashing red and yellow, two
   bands, the Grateful Dead and Big Brother and the Holding Company and a
   troop of weird girls in leotards leaping around the edges blowing dog
   whistles-and the Pranksters. Paul Foster has wrapped black friction tape
   all around his shoes and up over his ankles and swaddled his legs and hips
   and torso in it up to his rib cage, where begins a white shirt and then
   white bandaging all over his face and skull and just a slit for his eyes,
   over which he wears dark glasses. He also wears a crutch and a sign
   saying, You're in the Pepsi Generation and I'm a pimply freak!" Rotor!
   Also heads from all over, in serapes and mandala beads and Indian
   headbands and Indian beads, the great era for all that, and one in a
   leather jerkin with "Under Ass Wizard Mojo Indian Fighter" stenciled on
   the back. Mojo! Oh the freaking strobes turning every brain stem into a
   cauliflower erupting into corrugated ping-pong balls-can't stand it-and a
   girl rips off her shirt and dances bare-breasted with her great mihs
   breaking up into an endless stream of ruby-red erect nipples streaming out
   of the great milk-and-honey under the strobe lights. The dancing is
   ecstatic, a nice macaroni of braless breasts jiggling and cupcake bottoms
   wiggling and multiple arms writhing and leaping about. Thousands of
   straight intellectuals and culturati and square hippies, North Beach
   style, gawking and learning. Dr. Francis Rigney, Psychiatrist to the Beat
   Generation, looking on, and all the Big Daddies left over from the Beat
   period, Eric "Big Daddy" Nord and Tom "Big Daddy" Donahue, and the press,
   vibrating under Ron Boise's thunder machine. A great rout in progress, you
   understand.

   And in the center of the hall-the Pranksters' tower of Control. It had
   come to that, and it was perfect. Babbs had supervised the building of a
   great scaffolding of pipes and platforms in the center of the hall. It
   rose and rose, this tower, as the Pranksters added equipment, all the
   mikes and amplifiers and spots and projectors and all the rest of it, the
   very architecture of Control, finally. Babbs at the controls, Hagen up
   there taking movies; the Movie goes on. Kesey, meanwhile, was up on an
   even higher plateau of control, up on a balcony in a silver space suit
   complete with a big bubble space helmet. He conceived of it first as a
   disguise, so he could be there without the various courts being raggy and
   outraged, but everyone recognized the Space Man immediately, of course,
   and he perched up above the maelstrom with a projection machine with which
   you could write messages on acetate and project them in mammoth size on
   the walls.

   Zonker dancing in a spin of pure unadulterated bliss, higher than he had
   ever been in his life, which for Zonker was getting up there. Norman,
   smashed, but with a mission. Norman to circulate among the multitudes with
   movie camera. Only he has no power pack, so he has to plug the camera in a
   wall socket and go out with a great long cord. His eye pressed against the
   sighting lens and gradually the whole whirlpool coming into his one eye,
   unity, I, the vessel, receiving all, Atman and Brahman, letting it all
   flow in until-satori-the perfect state is reached and he realizes he is
   God. He has traveled miles through this writhing macaroni ecstasy mass and
   could the camera still possibly be plugged in?-or could that possibly
   matter? deus ex machina, with the world flowing into one eye. Becomes
   essential that he reach the Central Node, the Tower of Control, the great
   electric boom of the directional mike picking up the band sticking out
   from atop the scaffolding tower-and there it is-it is all there in this
   moment. Starts clambering up the scaffolding with the huge camera still
   over his shoulder and up to his eye, all funneling in, and the wire and
   plug snaking behind him, through the multitudes. And who might these irate
   forms be?-in truth, Babbs and Hagen, Babbs gesturing for Norman to get off
   the platform, he's in the way, there's no room, get the hell off of here-a
   cosmic laugh, since obviously they don't know who he is, viz., God.
   Norman, the meek, the mild, the retiring, the sideliner, laughs a cosmic
   laugh at them and keeps on coming. At any moment, he fully realizes, he
   can make them disappear down ... his eye, just two curds in the world
   flow, Babbs and Hagen.

   "Norman, if you don't get the hell off of here, I'm going to throw you
   off! "-Babbs looking huge and untamable in the same stance he gave the San
   Francisco cops at the Fillmore, and Norman's mind split just slightly
   along the chiasma, like a San Andreas fault, one part some durable
   hard-core fear of getting thrown off and breaking his ass, him, Norman,
   but the other, the Cosmic laugh of God at how useless Babbs's stance is
   now, vibrating slightly between God and not-God, but then the laugh comes
   in a wave, just the cosmic fact that he, Norman, now dares do this,
   defiance, the new I and there is not one thing, really, they can do about
   it-Babbs staring at this grinning, zonked figure with the huge camera
   clambering up the scaffolding. Babbs just throws his hands up, gives up,
   Norman ascends. God! in the very Tower of Control. Well, if I'm God, I can
   control this thing. Gazing down into the whirlpool. He gestures-and it
   comes to pass!-there is a ripple in the crowd there and again and there is
   a ripple in the crowd here-also so clear what is going to happen, he can
   predict it, a great eruption of ecstatic dancing in that clump, under the
   strobes, it will break out now, and it does, of course-a vibration along
   the crack, the fault, synchronicity spoken here, and we are at play, but
   they do it-start the music!-and it starts-satori, in the Central Node, as
   it was written-but I say unto you-and at that very moment, a huge message
   in red is written on the wall:

                   Anybody who knows he is God go up on stage

   Anybody?-The chiasmic halves vibrate, the God and the not-God, and then he
   realizes: Kesey wrote that. Kesey up on the balcony in his space suit
   wrote that with his projection machine and flashed it on the wall, in that
   very moment. What to do, Archangel of mine, Norman stares
   unbelieving-unbelieving in what?-up on stage climbs a spade with a wild
   head of natural spade hair with a headband wrapped around the hairline so
   the hair puffs up like a great gray dandelion, a huge shirt swimming under
   the lights, and it is Gaylord, one of the few spades in the whole thing,
   gleaming the glistening grin of acid zonk and going into a lovely godly
   little dance, this Gaylord God ... What the hell. Norman gestures toward
   the crowd, and it does not ripple. Not here and not there. He predicts
   that clump will rise up in ecstatic levitation, and it does not rise up.
   In fact, it just sinks to the floor like it was spat there, sad moon eyes
   glomming up in the acid stare. Sayonara, God. And yet... And yet...

                                     * * *

   THREE NIGHTS THE HUGE WILD CARNIVAL WENT ON. IT WAS A big thing on every
   level. For one thing, the Trips Festival grossed $12,500 in three days,
   with almost no overhead, and a new nightclub and dance-hall genre was
   born. Two weeks later Bill Graham was in business at the Fillmore
   auditorium with a Trips Festival going every weekend and packing them in.
   For the acid heads themselves, the Trips Festival was like the first
   national convention of an underground movement that had existed on a
   hush-hush cell-by-cell basis. The heads were amazed at how big their own
   ranks had become-and euphoric over the fact that they could come out in
   the open, high as baboons, and the sky, and the law, wouldn't fall down on
   them. The press went along with the notion that this had been an LSD
   experience without the LSD. Nobody in the hip world of San Francisco had
   any such delusion, and the Haight-Ashbury era began that weekend.

   The Trips Festival changed many things. But as soon as the whirlpool died
   down, Kesey was right back where he started, so far as the grinning
   lopsided frowning world of the San Mateo and San Francisco County courts
   were concerned. The bastids were digging in for prisoner's base. They had
   already dug him out of the place in La Honda. Part of the fiat of Judge de
   Matteis was that Kesey get out of La Honda and sell his place to somebody
   who had nothing to do with him or his works and stay out of San Mateo
   County except to see his probation officer or travel through on the Harbor
   Freeway or over the territorial boundaries of San Mateo County by airplane
   and remove himself and all his influences from said County. So Kesey and
   Faye and the kids moved into the Spread, Babbs's place, in Santa Cruz.
   Winding his way down there on January 23-there was a warrant waiting for
   his arrest on the grounds of violating probation.

   Well, that's their Movie, Tonto, and we all know how that one ends. Three
   years in the San Mateo donjon, plus the five or eight or twenty they come
   up with in San Francisco to teach a lesson while the iron and the spittle
   are hot to all the Trips Festival dope fiends. Kesey called an immediate
   briefing, and remember that little abjuration a couple months ago about
   prepare for Mexico... ?

   So they gathered at the Spread.

   "If society wants me to be an outlaw," said Kesey, "then I'll be an
   outlaw, and a damned good one. That's something people need. People at all
   times need outlaws."

   The Pranksters comprehended it all at once.

   So here is the current fantasy: tonight he is going to split for Mexico.
   He'll go across the border in the back of Ron Boise's truck. Boise was
   down at Babbs's at the time, and he had a truck that served as a kind of
   mobile studio. It had all his welding equipment and acetylene torches and
   the like and he would work back there on the mud flats out back, shaping
   old car fenders into the erotic poses of the Kama Sutra. Finally Roy
   Seburn's psychedelic car, his miniature bus, had been fed to the torches
   back there, too, as it was broken down for good. Nothing lasts. Art is not
   eternal. They would head for Puerto Vallarta. He would use another
   Prankster's driver's license as I.D. in case he needed it down there.
   Meanwhile, as a cover story, one last grand prank. The Suicide Trip.

   Kesey would write a suicide note. Then D-, who looked uncommonly like
   him-Dee would dress up like him and get in an old panel truck that was
   around there and drive up the coast, toward Oregon, and pick out a likely
   cliff and smash the truck into a tree trunk and get out and leave the
   suicide note on the seat of the truck and throw his sky-blue boots down by
   the shore so it would look like he had dived in the water and gone out to
   sea, never to come back to his swamp of troubles. The idea was that Dee
   would look enough like Kesey, especially in a Prankster costume, so that
   if anybody did happen to see him driving along the way, they would
   remember him as someone answering Kesey's description. Let 'em unravel
   that one. Even if they don't fall for it, at least it might take the heat
   off. Why should we go to all this trouble-the ninny might be lying on the
   bottom of the ocean, them damn dope fiends ...

   "I hope Dee doesn't do a Dee-out," Mountain Girl said. But she was
   optimistic. The whole thing had a lot of elan du Prank.

   That night Kesey and Mountain Girl got stoned on grass and started
   composing the great suicide note:

   "Last words. A vote for Barry is a vote for fun. I, Ken Kesey, being of
   (ahem) sound mind and body, do hereby leave the whole scene to Faye,
   Corporation, cash and the works (and it occurs to me here that nobody is
   going to buy this prank and now it occurs to me that I like that even
   better).. ."

   Shee-ut, this was fun. Put-on after put-on bubbled up in their brains, and
   all the bullshit metaphors of destiny, all the bullshit lines a good
   bullshit poet would come up with upon looking the Grim Creeper in the
   arsehole:

   "Wind, wind send me not this place, though, onward ..."

   More! More! Louder music, more wine!

   "... Ocean, ocean, ocean, I'll beat you in the end, I'll break you this
   time. I'll go through with my heels your hungry ribs..."

   On and on it went, like a running account of the mad-drive-to-be up the
   coast, looking for his favorite cliff, to jump off of, presumably, the
   whole scene bubbling up in his brain and Mountain Girl's on the ratty rug
   in Babbs's living room. Hell, let's throw in some acid-they'll believe the
   damn ninny dope fiend would take the dread LSD and break his ass for
   good-and hell, slam the freaking vehicle into a tree, bleed verisimilitude
   all over the California littoral:

   "... I've lost the ocean again. Beautiful. I drive hundreds of miles
   looking for my particular cliff, get so trapped behind acid I can't find
   the ocean, end up slamming into a redwood ..."

   Beautiful. Ready, Ron? He gets into Boise's truck and they head off south
   for San Diego, the Mexican border, Tijuana and the land of all competent
   Outlaws.

                                   Acid Test

   WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PRANKSTERS AFTER KESEY'S flight to Mexico was so much
   like what happened to the League after Leo fled in Hermann Hesse's book
   The Journey to the East-well, it was freaking weird, this particular synch
   ... exactly ... the Pranksters ! and the great bus trip of 1964! their
   whole movie. No; it went on. Hesse's fantasy coincided with theirs all the
   way. It went on-all the way to this weird divide-

   The leader of the League in The Journey to the East was named Leo. He was
   never openly known as the leader: like Kesey, he was the "non-navigator"
   of the brotherhood. And Leo suddenly left "in the middle of the dangerous
   gorge of Morbio Inferiore," just when the League was deepest into its
   Journey to the East, in the critical phase of a trip that was being
   alternately denounced and wondered at. "From that time, certainty and
   unity no longer existed in our community, although the great idea still
   kept us together. How well I remember those first disputes! They were
   something so new and unheard-of in our hitherto perfectly united League.
   They were conducted with respect and politeness-at least in the beginning.
   At first they led neither to fierce conflicts nor personal reproaches or
   insults-at first we were still an inseparable, united brotherhood
   throughout the world ..." Things got more and more bitter, and the
   narrator, "H.," left after the Morbio Inferiore. And the narrator,
   Hartweg, left after ...

   Very weird, the synch!

   With Kesey gone, Babbs became the leader. There was no meeting, no vote,
   not even a parting word from Kesey. Babbs becomes the leader-the ... group
   mind knew that at once, without a second thought. They packed up
   everything at La Honda and took it up to Oregon, to Kesey's parents' home.
   The Archives they stashed at the Spread and, later, up at Chuck's house in
   Oregon. This and that they bequeathed to other heads, like the great round
   table with the Hell's Angels' carvings all over it. They gave that to a
   new psychedelic group, the Anonymous Artists of America, at a place called
   Rancho Diablo up at Skylonda. Whatever they could use for the Acid Tests
   they took along.

   Babbs moved the Acid Test scene to Los Angeles and the bus lumbered on
   down there. They had hardly gotten there before the soft rumblings
   started-"certainty and unity no longer existed in our community, although
   the great idea still kept us together. How well I remember those first
   disputes!" Babbs gives too many orders-Kesey, the non-navigator, merely
   expressed a will and merely waited for it to move forward in the Group
   Mind. Babbs runs this like the Army... like the Boy Scouts... Babbs's
   put-ons suddenly seemed pure sarcasm. His cryptic comments, his candor,
   seemed cruel. Some of the Pranksters even took to sympathizing with poor
   wretches like Pancho Pillow; the universally put-down acid-rapping fool,
   Pancho.

   Pancho, ever in the throes of self-laceration, was still desperate to be
   on the bus. The poor bastard spent his last earthly dime and traveled from
   San Francisco to Los Angeles and caught up with the bus in Lemon Grove one
   day. Pancho came ambling up with a huge grin of brotherhood and started to
   climb up the steps and Babbs met him at the door of the bus.

   "I don't think anybody wants you here," said Babbs.

   "What do you mean?" says Pancho. "Can't I come on the bus ? "

   "There's nobody on the bus who wants you on the bus."

   Pancho's grin is wiped off, of course, and his eyes start batting around
   like pinballs, trying to make out who is inside the bus-you all know me,
   I'm Pancho!

   "Well... I know I get on some people's nerves," says Pancho, "but I came
   all the way here to be with you guys, and I spent all my money getting
   here-"

   "We don't care," says somebody else's voice, on the bus.

   "Look," says Pancho, "I'll shut up, I'll do whatever you want. I just want
   to help with the Tests. I'll do anything-"

   "We don't care." Somebody else's voice, on the bus.

   "-odd jobs, run errands, there must be a thousand things-"

   "We don't care."

   Pancho stands there, speechless, his face bursts with red.

   "See," says Babbs, "it's like I said. I don't think there's anybody who
   wants you on here."

   Numb Pancho backs down off the steps and trudges off in Lemon Grove.

   Well, they had a good laugh over that. The freaking Pancho Pillow! A
   bad-trip freak if there ever was one! A breaker of balls extraordinaire!
   The human bummer: ::::: but it was a laugh with a metallic aftertaste,
   this joke on Pancho ::::::

   Babbs had gotten hold of an old mansion in L.A., called the Sans Souci, a
   great incredible moldering old place with a dome and a stone balustrade,
   all crumbling and moldering, but with style. When the owner found a bunch
   of beatniks in there, he freaked, but that was later. Anyway, one day they
   were all in there and one Prankster said a very unPrankster thing. He
   spoke up and said:

   "I want to voice this idea: I can't stand Margie and I don't want her
   around."

   Unfreakingbelievable. He was talking about Marge the Barge. So then all
   eyes went to Babbs, who was now thrust into the Kesey role of resolving
   all. Babbs turns to Marge the Barge and says:

   "What do you think about that?"

   Marge says: "I think that's ridiculous," and with such quiet flat
   conviction that nobody else says anything.

   A small moment-but one more moment in the gathering schism, the Babbs
   loyalists versus the had-enough-of-Babbs. Later they would realize they
   were in many cases merely blaming Babbs for the mysterious sense of loss
   in their venture. They were casting about for an explanation, and Babbs
   was It. What they had lost of course, was the magical cement of Kesey's
   charisma. "It seemed that the more certain his loss became, the more
   indispensable he seemed; without Leo, his handsome face, his good humor
   and his songs, without his enthusiasm for our great undertaking, the
   undertaking itself seemed in some mysterious way to lose meaning."

   IN FACT, BABBS CARRIED THE ACID TESTS INTO LOS ANGELES with an amazing
   determination. The Pranksters were now out of their home territory, the
   San Francisco area, but they performed with an efficiency they never knew
   they had before. It was as if they were all picking up on Babbs's
   exhortation of months ago: "We've got to learn how to function on acid."
   They were soaring out of their gourds themselves, but they were pulling
   off Acid Tests that seemed like they were orchestrated.

   Babbs was in great form, as I say, and he had also hooked up with a
   remarkable head named Hugh Romney, a poet, actor, and comedian who had
   gone the whole route, starting back in the Beat Generation days and was
   now into the LSD thing and had "discovered the Management," as he put it,
   "and when you discover the Management there's nothing to do but go to work
   for it." So Romney and his friend Bonnie Jean were now on the bus, and
   they all set out to-nothing more, nothing less-turn on Los Angeles to the
   Management. .. Yesss... The first Test was at Paul Sawyer's church in
   Northridge, just out from Los Angeles in the San Fernando Valley .. .
   Sawyer has never lost his willingness to experiment and is on the bus
   himself. And if the Sport Shirts could see these ... new experimental
   rites... including music, dance, and sacrifice-the sacrifice?-well... it
   was not strictly an Acid Test, but a "happening," which had become a
   harmless and un-loaded word in Cultural circles, even in Sawyer's Valley
   Unitarian-Universalist Church. A marvelous modern building shaped like a
   huge Bermuda onion, it was, forming one great towering . . . Dome, with
   fantastic acoustics like it had been created for the current fantasy
   itself. So the Pranksters moved in and wired and wound up the place, and
   hundreds arrived for the "happening," partaking of Prankster magic and
   pineapple chili, which was a concoction the Pranksters served, on the vile
   side in taste, but pineapple chili nonetheless, a wacky thought in itself.
   And Cassady had a microphone and started rapping, and Romney had a
   microphone and started rapping, and he was great, and Babbs and Paul
   Foster, flying with the God Rotor and not stuttering at all... People
   dancing in the most ecstatic way and getting so far into the thing, the
   straight multitudes even, that even they took microphones, and suddenly
   there was no longer any separation between the entertainers and the
   entertained at all, none of that well-look-at-you-startled-squares
   condescension of the ordinary happening. Hundreds were swept up in an
   experience, which built up like a dream typhoon, peace on the smooth
   liquid centrifugal whirling edge. In short, everybody in The Movie, on the
   bus, and it was beautiful... They were like... on! the Pranksters-now
   primed to draw the hundreds, the thousands, the millions into the new
   experience, and in the days ahead they came rushing in :::::

   ::::: Clair Brush, for one. Yes. She was a girl in her twenties, a pretty
   redhead, who worked for Art Kunkin, the editor of the hip circuit weekly,
   the Los Angeles Free Press. Her old friend Doc Stanley had called her up
   before the Test at Sawyer's church and said, Clair, there is going to be a
   happening in a Unitarian church in the Valley that you really ought to
   pick up on, and so forth ... But one of the things Clair did at the Free
   Press was compile a calendar of events for the hip circuit and this was
   the big season of "happenings" and she had been through all that a dozen
   times, and each one was always billed as the wave of the future, and was
   inevitably a drag. So she didn't go. Ummmm ::::: However :::::

   ::::: In hearing about it from people who did attend, though, she decided
   to go to the next one :::::

   ::::: which was set for Watts, on Lincoln's Birthday, February 12, 1966.
   Watts! the very Watts where hardly five months before the freaking
   revolution of the blacks had broken out, the symbol of all that was
   catastrophic and hopeless in American life, and what is this strange space
   ship now approaching Watts, the very Youth Opportunities center
   itself--Youth Opportunities!--for the trip beyond catastrophe :::::

   ::::: "I think what decided me"-Clair is recalling it for me-"was
   someone's description of Art Kunkin's spontaneous participation and
   enjoyment of the evening in the church. Most of the people there were
   given to improvisation as required, but Arthur and I share a reserve in
   crowds.

   "Anyway. The Watts site-it was actually Compton, an incorporated city on
   the fringe of Watts-was chosen for reasons unknown to me. The best guesses
   I've heard have to do with the politics of taking such a party into the
   recently stricken neighborhood, as a friendship-thing; also a
   humorous-ironical?-site for such carryings-on.

   "The building was a warehouse, part of a Youth Opportunities center, but
   still vacant. They-the Center people-were using or were going to use the
   building as a workshop for manual trades, possibly automotive?
   Job-retraining, etc. It was legally leased for 24 or 48 hours by Kesey's
   group, with money, and the caretaker of the center was present at all
   times during the Acid Test.

   "Announcements were made in the usual way, Free Press and KPFK calendar,
   etc., and around 200 people were in attendance. When I arrived, nothing
   had started ... people were clustered in small groups, sitting on mats and
   blankets around the walls. The room, the main room, was huge ... my
   conception of feet, in yards and such, is bad, but I'd guess maybe 50 by
   25. There was a smaller room to the east and bathroom to the west, and the
   large room had a corridor running along the south wall which had open
   windows waist-high without glass... through which the scene inside could
   be observed.

   "I had driven my car down, giving two people a ride, but I left them
   immediately ... went to join some friends who had some rose wine and were
   sitting on a pad on the floor. As I said, none of the effects had started
   ... but shortly there was an announcement (I think by Neal Cassady, but I
   didn't know him then) that the evening would begin. Films were projected
   on the south wall, with a commentary ... films of Furthur, the bus, the
   people in the bus ... the commentary was a rather dull travelogue and the
   film seemed fairly uninspired and confused.

   "Remember now, I'm a novice. I'd never even been 'high' on 'pot' or any
   kind of pill or anything... my strongest experience had been with alcohol.
   I knew a few 'heads' but didn't think much of the whole thing ... had
   tried pot a few times and nothing impressed me, except for the unpleasant
   taste.

   "This may explain why a lot of people were digging the film, laughing, and
   also why a lot of people were there ... I'm sure that I was one of a
   minority who had no idea what to expect. The word must have been passed,
   but didn't get to me. Also I think a lot of those in attendance had heard
   of Kesey's things and were very aware of what was being done. Not old
   unworldly Clair. Story of my life.

   "The film continued, some slides were shown of flowers and patterns, this
   and that.. . then a large trash can, plastic, was carried to the middle of
   the room, and all were invited to help themselves to the Kool-Aid it
   contained. There was no big rush to the refreshment stand . . . people
   wandered up, it was being served in paper cups, and since Kool-Aid is a
   staple in the homes of Del Close and Hugh Romney and other friends of
   mine, I thought it quite a natural thing to serve . .. had a cup, had
   another, wandered and talked for a while, had another ..."

   . . . Ironically, for Clair, anyway, it was Romney's inspiration to serve
   Electric Kool-Aid, as he called it. They had all... yes... laced it good
   and heavy with LSD. It was a prank, partly, but mainly it was the natural
   culmination of the Acid Tests. It was a gesture, it was sheer generosity
   giving all this acid away, it was truly turning on the world, inviting all
   in to share the Pranksters' ecstasy of the All-one ... all become divine
   vessels in unison, and it is all there in Kool-Aid and a paper cup.
   Cassady immediately drank about a gallon of it. Actually there were two
   cans. Romney took the microphone and said, "This one over here is for the
   little folk and this one over here is for the big folk. This one over here
   is for the kittens and this one over here is for the tigers," and so forth
   and so on. As far as he was concerned, he was doing everything but putting
   a sign on the loaded batch saying LSD. Romney was so thoroughly into the
   pudding himself it never occurred to him that a few simpler souls might
   have wandered into this unlikely way station in Watts and simply not know
   ... or think that all his veiled instructions probably referred to gin,
   like the two crystal bowls of punch at either end of the long white table
   at a wedding reception... or just not hear, like Clair Brush-

   "Severn Darden was there, and Del Close, of course, and I knew them from
   the Second City in Chicago. Severn and I were standing under a strobe
   light (first time I'd seen one, and they are kicky) doing an improvisation
   ... he was a jealous husband, I an unfaithful wife, something simple and
   funny. He was choking me and throwing me around (gently, of course) and
   suddenly I began to laugh ... and laugh ... and the laugh was more
   primitive, more gut-tearing, than anything I had ever known. It came from
   somewhere so deep inside that I had never felt it before ... and it
   continued ... and it was uncontrollable ... and wonderful. Something
   snapped me back and I realized that there was nothing funny ... nothing to
   laugh about.. . what had I been laughing at?

   "I looked around and people's faces were distorted ... lights were
   flashing everywhere ... the screen (sheets) at the end of the room had
   three or four different films on it at once, and the strobe light was
   flashing faster than it had been ... the band, the Grateful Dead, was
   playing but I couldn't hear the music ... people were dancing ... someone
   came up to me and I shut my eyes and with a machine he projected images on
   the back of my eyelids (I really think this happened ... I asked and there
   was such a machine)... and nothing was in perspective, nothing had any
   touch of normalcy or reality ... I was afraid, because I honestly thought
   that it was all in my mind, and that I had finally flipped out.

   "I sought a person I trusted, stopping and asking people what was
   happening. . . mostly they laughed, not believing that I didn't know. I
   found a man I knew not very well but with whom I felt simpatico from the
   first time we met. I asked him what was happening, and if it was all me,
   and he laughed and held me very close and told me that the Kool-Aid had
   been 'spiked' and that I was just beginning my first LSD experience ...
   and not to be afraid, but to neither accept nor reject... to always keep
   open, not to struggle or try to make it stop. He held me for a long time
   and we grew closer than two people can be ... our bones merged, our skin
   was one skin, there was no place where we could separate, where he stopped
   and I began. This closeness is impossible to describe in any but
   melodramatic terms... still, I did feel that we had merged and become one
   in the true sense, that there was nothing that could separate us, and that
   it had meaning beyond anything that had ever been. (Note, a year and two
   months later ... three months ... I later read about 'imprint' and that it
   was possible that we would continue to be meaningful to each other no
   matter what circumstances... I think this is true ... the person in
   question remains very special in my life, and I in his, though we have no
   contact and see each other infrequently ... we share something that will
   last. Oh hell! There's no way to talk about that without sounding goopy.)

   "I wasn't afraid any more and started to look around. The setting for the
   above scene had been the smaller room which was illuminated only by black
   light, which turns people into beautiful color and texture. I saw about
   ten people sitting directly under the black light, which was back-draped
   by a white (luminescent lavender, then) sheet, painting on disembodied
   mannequins with fluorescent paint... and on each other, their clothes,
   etc. I stood under the light and drops of paint fell on my foot and
   sandal, and it was exquisite. I returned to this light frequently ... it
   was peaceful and beautiful beyond description. My skin had depth and
   texture under the light... a velvety purple. I remember wishing it could
   be that color always. (I still do.)

   "There was much activity in the large room. People were dancing and the
   band was playing-but I couldn't hear them. I can't remember a note of the
   music, because the vibrations were so intense. I am music-oriented-sing,
   play instruments, etc.-which is why this seems unusual to me. I stood
   close to the band and let the vibrations engulf me. They started in my
   toes and every inch of me was quivering with them ... they made a journey
   through my nervous system (I remember picturing myself as one of the
   charts we had studied in biology which shows the nerve network), traveling
   each tiny path, finally reaching the top of my head, where they exploded
   in glorious patterns of color and line .. . perhaps like a Steinberg
   cartoon? ... I remember intense colors, but always with black lines ...
   not exactly patterns, but with some outlines and definitions.

   "The strobe light broke midway ... I think they blew something in it...
   but that was a relief, because I had been drawn to it but it disturbed the
   part of me that was trying to hang onto reality ... playing with
   time-sense was something I'd never done ... and I found it irresistible
   but frightening.

   "The Kool-Aid had been served at ten or so. Almost from the first the
   doorway was crowded with people walking in and out, and policemen. There
   were, throughout the evening, at least six different groups of police . ..
   starting with the Compton City police, then the Highway Patrol, sheriffs
   deputies, L.A.P.D. and the vice/narco squad. I seem to remember them in
   groups of five or six, standing just inside the doorway, watching,
   sometimes talking to passers-by, but making no hostile gestures or
   threatening statements. It seems now that they must have realized that
   whatever was going on was more than could be coped with ... and a jail
   full of 150 people on acid was infinitely undesirable ... so they'd look,
   comment, go away, and others would come . . . this continued through the
   night.

   "Dignitaries from the neighborhood attended . . . I'd guess around
   midnight, but I've no sense of the time of any of this, until 6 a.m. or
   so, when I finally sat down (I had walked, danced or stood from 10 p.m.
   on, not wanting to sit down ... for what reason I can't imagine). There
   were two or three women, about seven men. One of the men was dressed in a
   white suit and had a Shriner's cap on-I thought he was Elijah Muhammed.
   They smiled, watched, talked with some of the people ... stayed for about
   half an hour, and left, wishing us a happy evening. No Kool-Aid was in
   evidence at that time, of course ... it had been removed quickly. The
   neighborhood people were Negro, naturally. They seemed to have no idea of
   the party as being anything but a gathering of young people, and appeared
   to be pleased to welcome us to the neighborhood. I remember one of the
   women was carrying a child and many people stooped to play with him ...
   probably a two-year-old boy.

   "The caretaker of the building was present for the whole time. It seems
   he'd go back to the office part and sleep for a while, or maybe just get
   away from the noise and the chaos... but periodically would check to see
   that everything was all right. He was friendly, happy, but very, very
   confused at the strange activities. "Mostly I'd call the Acid Test a
   master production. Everything was very carefully meshed and calculated to
   produce the LSD effect, so that I have no idea where the production
   stopped and my own head took over. The films being shown were so vivid,
   with patterns and details of flowers and trees and often just color
   surrounded by black lines and fast-moving scenery and details of hands and
   such ... again, I avoided getting hung up watching them ...

   "People were standing outside ... it was a cold, clear night... someone
   panicked, got in his car and drove away, burning rubber ... I wanted to go
   back to my house, but knew that driving would be insane. Bonnie (who was
   Hugh Romney's lady) was standing alone ... we touched hands and smiled,
   knowing, caring . . . Furthur was parked in the street. I went alone and
   sat in the bus, and heard and felt the spirits of the people who lived in
   it. . . we (the bus and I) went on a journey through time, and I knew them
   so well... I went back inside and found the man whose face was painted
   half gold and half silver, with a bushy head of curly hair, who had seemed
   earlier to be frightening and strange"-

   -this was Paul Foster-"and looked at him and understood. The costumes of
   the Merry Pranksters had seemed bizarre, and now they were beautiful and
   right. I recalled a poster which we'd had on the ceiling of the Free Press
   when our offices were under : the Fifth Estate ... it's a poster for a
   production of 'The Beard' and has 'Grah roor ograrh ... lion lioness... oh
   grahr ...' (like that) printed on it... and for that moment I understood
   exactly what was being said.

   "A great flash of insight came to me. I've forgotten it now, but there was
   one instant when everything fell into place and made sense, and I said
   aloud, 'Oh, of course!'... why didn't I see all this before, why couldn't
   I have realized all these things and not resisted them so much. That
   didn't last, and hasn't recurred.

   "There was a witch who was very kind and sent out the best warm and lovely
   vibrations. She was wearing red velvet and she's an older lady, really a
   witch in the best possible way. I was glad she was there, and she was
   smiling and understanding and enjoying, mothering those few who were not
   reacting well.

   "There was one girl who was wrestling with God. She was with friends, and
   I think she was all right after a few hours. There was one man who became
   completely withdrawn ... I want to say catatonic, because we tried to
   bring him out of it, and could not make contact at all... he was sort of a
   friend of mine, and I had some responsibility for getting him back to town
   ... he had a previous history of mental hospitals, lack of contact with
   reality, etc., and when I realized what had happened, I begged him not to
   drink the Kool-Aid, but he did ... and it was very bad. These are the only
   two people I know of who did have bad experiences, but I'm sure I wasn't
   in contact with everyone.

   "I told you about the tape recording ('Who cares? ... I don't care ...')
   and how it was used again at the next one. Show biz."

   -Show biz-yesssss-and nooooo-Clair was soaring on LSD, wondering what was
   happening to herself and whether she was going mad, and so forth, and the
   most crazed scream rang out:

   "Who cares!"

   And then: "Ray! ... Ra-a-a-a-ay! .. . Who cares!"

   Not even such a manic scream could have been heard over the general roar
   and rush of the Test ordinarily, over the Grateful Dead wailing, or
   certainly not with such clarity, except for the fact that it was being
   picked up by a microphone and amplified out of huge theater horns-

   "Who cares!"

   That was just the thing for somebody like Clair to hear, Clair who thought
   she was going mad-the sound of a woman freaking out, blowing her mind, all
   of it amplified as if it were tearing out of every gut in the place and up
   through every brain. So Clair's protector and impromptu guide put his arms
   around her again and told her, "It's a tape they made. It's just a put-on.
   Hugh Romney made it." Well, that seemed plausible. Hugh was an actor and a
   great satirist and put-on artist and prankster ... In fact, between
   screams, there was Hugh's voice sure enough, coming over the microphone:

   "Ladies and gentlemen, there's a cop who's come apart in the next room!
   Will somebody go in there and put that cop back together again ! "

   "Ray! Ra-a-a-a-ay!... It's too perfect!"

   Then Romney's voice coming back in: "Does anybody have any tranquilizers?
   There's somebody having a little trouble in the next room."

   The next room was the anteroom off the big hall that Clair had started out
   in. There was a girl in there sitting on the floor and freaking out in the
   most complete way. Just the thing for acid veterans. These things happen,
   what you need is-and Pranksters and other hierophants of the acid world
   heard about the girl sitting in there and screaming. Who cares! and
   freaking out. Norman Hartweg and Romney came in there, and here was a
   fairly pretty girl, if only her face wasn't so contorted, with one
   crippled leg, shrieking Who cares! and Ra-a-a-a-ay. Ray, the very Ray
   himself, and Romney looks at Ray and sees the picture at once. Ray is a
   big guy with a crewcut and a T-shirt and a sleeveless jacket or vest or
   something on, which shows his muscles very well. He looks like some sailor
   who fell in with a bunch of hippies and now he wonders what in the fock
   has happened- "Ray!"

   The worst possible guy in the world to deal with the Who Cares Girl. This
   is a job for experts, and we have them here, some of the greatest acid
   experts in the world, Romney, Norman, the Hassler-he comes in-and here
   comes Babbs-and they're all gathered around her in a
   bunch-Attention!-remember Rachel Rightbred!-and it came to pass!-and they
   give her the freakout expertise: "... don't fight it..."

   "... go with it..."

   "... neither accept nor deny ..."

   ". . . go with the flow . . ."

   "... we're with you ..."

   "... you're in the hands of experts..."

   -experts-and the Pranksters are there rapping over her, riff after riff of
   words-and then Romney got hold of some Thorazine, a tranquilizer that is
   good at aborting bad LSD trips and he says, "Here, take this-"

   -take this-the Who Cares Girl and Ray look at this costumed freak amid a
   group of costumed freaks, all zonked, trying to hand her a capsule of God
   knows what-diabolism-and Ray throws the Thorazine away and the Who Cares
   Girl throws it away, the capsules go skidding across the floor, and the
   Who Cares Girl goes:

   harruummmppparummmparrrrumppparruuuuuuumparum pauharuharummmpa mumbling
   along, drifting in and out of the freakout, giggling for a stretch and
   they say ah she's coming out of it and then:

   "Who cares! ... Ray! ... Ra-a-a-a-ay! ... Oh, what's the use! ... Sex! ...
   Ray! Sex! ... Who cares!"

   That phrase!-it sticks in Romney's head. He can't get it out. Her scream
   shrieks over the hall, because now Babbs has brought up the microphone and
   holds it near her, right in front of Ray, solicitously, like this will do
   it. Ray's head sprockets around inanely. Babbs is getting it all over the
   microphone to make it part of the test-not an isolated event-but All-one,
   anachoretic freak-out-Who cares! Romney looks at Babbs and Who
   cares!-well, Babbs cares, with one part of him, but with another his
   devotion is to the Test, to the Archives, a freakout for the Archives,
   freaked out on tape in the Archives, Who Cares in the Prankster Archives,
   and the cry wails over the hall, into every brain, including Clair's-

   Romney can't get this insane cry out of his head, Who cares, and it
   becomes the Who Cares Test for him, and he is back at the microphone, with
   his mission now, his voice furrowing into the microphone:

   "Listen, this girl's brains are coming out! and who cares? This girl's
   coming apart! and who cares? This girl's breaking up into crispy chips!
   and who cares? This girl's caked in the dust, nylon wall-to-wall on her
   eyeballs! and who cares?"

   -and it was very clear. Everybody who cared would do something, pour on
   the Energy if nothing else, bleed Dimensional Kreemo for her, if they
   truly cared. It became a test for Romney, he could feel it, to find the
   depths of how much he cared-

   Who cares! she shrieks

   He cares! he feels it, and feels himself growing-

   -while the tapes reel it all in.

   FINALLY, EVEN AT THE WATTS TEST THEY WEAR DOWN, AND those who are not into
   the pudding begin to drift off, and the Prankster diehards and a few
   discoverers like Clair Brush are still there, and Norman can tell it is
   coming, the magic hour, and Hassler gets up in a blue pageboy costume and
   does a funny beautiful slow dance to the music that is just perfect... and
   Page is working behind him with the projectors, the film projectors and
   the slide projectors, and he sets up a really kind of gorgeous collage,
   moving projections on top of still projections ... and the Pranksters sit
   amazed and delighted and he makes slow changes, abstract patterns and
   projections from the slides and... it all fits together. . . everything ..
   .

   About 6 a.m., more cops, narcos now, six in plainclothes-and one of the
   diehard three-o'clock discoverers walks up to them and announces with a
   look of total acid-stoned glistening sincerity:

   "Listen, I've got more Awareness, more ... Awareness, in my little
   fingernail... My Awareness is so superior to yours that... uh ..
   ."-obviously from the glistening strain on his face, there is no metaphor,
   no conceit, that can be concocted in the English language that is enormous
   enough to express just how superior, and so his face falls back into a
   sweet sincere look, slightly played out, and he says: "How about getting
   us some cigarettes? We're all out."

   Strangely, one of them did and returned very quickly with a carton of
   Kools, which he passed around. Around 9 a.m. only the Pranksters, Clair
   and a few others are still around-and more cops-and finally they say to
   Babbs that he ought to get everybody out now, the L.A. sun is up, the good
   spades of Watts are going to work ... and the Pranksters troop out into
   the L.A. sunlight, the Devil with an orange face with silver stars, a tall
   wild-haired guy with half his face silver and half gold, Day-Glo crazies
   trooping out into the sunlight at 9 a.m. out of the chilled Pandemonium
   hatchery ...

   And Clair Brush: "It seems that's about it... I've rambled incredibly ...
   Did it last? Am I different? I can't remember. It seems so, but I am not
   sure. When I get under black light, or a strobe, it comes back vividly ...

   "Del Close told me later I was wandering around looking 'wonderful... in
   the sense of full of wonder.' That's the best description I can imagine.

   "I've taken LSD twice since then. Each time was different and much less
   dramatic, more personal, milder. The only strong similarity is the
   physical effect, which, for me, consists of contractions quite like labor
   pains and a quivering of the nerve-endings ... anticipatory ... for
   prolonged periods, the feelings of being on the verge of orgasm without
   any contact at all... these things occurred all three times. Otherwise,
   all have been different.

   "Take it again? Oh, probably someday ... but no urgency, no desire to run
   to my friendly corner pusher. I think the best way is to take it with a
   lover, but someone you're willing to have live in your head for a long,
   long time. Not too many of those around. It's a closeness not easily
   dismissed. "All, all. Enough, I hope."

                                     * * *

   ABOUT 1 P.M. THE PHONE STARTS RINGING IN ROMNEY's apartment, waking him
   up: "Romney, you guys ought to be shot!..." "Seven people committed!"...
   "Freaked out!"... "Atrocity!" And finally one from the L.A. police:

   "Are you Romney? Listen, we got some two-tone dude down here-"

   Oh, the Di-men-sion-al Kree-mo ... That would be Paul Foster. Four, five,
   six hundred people had been in that madhouse all night long having a
   goddamned orgy for themselves-and the cops couldn't lay a hand on them.
   So-in the sour-milk L.A. sunlight of 9 a.m. they had seen this gangling
   character rocking away from the building like a Druid, half his face gold,
   the other half silver, so they busted the mother, for being . . . well. .
   . drunk in public, or something equally likely. But by 1 p.m. they wish to
   hell somebody would come pick up this two-tone dude ...

   Christ, man! It's too much for us even! We wash our hands of this :::::
   Atrocity :::::

   ::::: what... exactly have we done? and :::::

   ::::: even to some Pranksters, the anti-Babbs faction, the Test was a
   debacle. They doubted the ethics of springing the acid in the Kool-Aid, on
   the one hand, and thought the treatment of the Who Cares Girl, piping her
   freakout over the speakers, was cruel. Shortly after they got back to L.A.
   from La Jolla, the Schism broke out true and rife, out front. This was a
   great little Morbio Inferiore all its own, the Life Magazine Divide.

   The Watts Test in L.A., coming on top of the Trips Festival in San
   Francisco, had caused the fast-rising psychedelic thing to explode right
   out of the underground in a way nobody had dreamed of. Leary and Alpert
   and their experiments had had plenty of publicity, but that seemed like a
   fairly isolated thing with a couple of Harvard docs at the helm and being
   pretty solemn-faced and esoteric about it, all in all. This new San
   Francisco-L.A. LSD thing, with wacked-out kids and delirious rock 'n'
   roll, made it seem like the dread LSD had caught on like an infection
   among the youth-which, in fact, it had. Very few realized that it had all
   emanated from one electric source: Kesey and the Merry Pranksters.

   A team from Life magazine turned up, led by a photographer, Larry
   Schiller, who was on to the LSD world and had taken the pictures at the
   Hollywood Test. They interviewed the Pranksters and took pictures and said
   they were going to do a big spread on the acid scene and, they hoped, put
   the Pranksters on the cover. So they hailed the bus on over to a big photo
   studio and Schiller convened them all. Then-Babbs refused to go in. But
   the rest of them, Norman, Hagen, Cassady, a whole flock of them, went on
   in, and Schiller took a lot of pictures. To Norman it seemed square. For
   one thing, the guy was working in black and white, and the most obvious
   thing about the Pranksters was color, Day-Glo, the brighter the better,
   the more vibrations the better. Then Schiller had them all sit down in a
   group, against a black background, and in the middle they had Cassady
   stand up and wave his arms up and down like a crow. He took the pictures
   in strobe, and this would make Cassady look like he had multi-arms, like
   the great god Shiva. This strobe thing was at the time new in psychedelic
   photography, and the mass media would never tire of it. Recreates the acid
   experience, etc. Then Schiller told certain people to stay around for
   individual shots, colorful characters like Cassady, and Paul Foster with
   his wild mutton chops and Importancy Coat, and Norman, maybe because he
   had a beard. The usual... The others went on outside where Babbs was.
   Finally they all left, the ones who had stayed for the individual shots,
   and when they got outside, the bus was gone. Clean gone. Babbs, Mountain
   Girl, Zonker, Walker, and the others-split.

   Hagen couldn't believe it. "Why-we've been pranked!" he said.

   Pranksters-and the Pranked.

   Things being like they were to begin with, the prank took on fundamental
   meaning. Those who got pranked finally made their way back to the
   moldering Sans Souci, and Babbs & Co. had cleared out of there, too,
   taking all the money and the food. Babbs left word that they, the inner
   nucleus, were going off to hold a Test of their own and would rejoin the
   Satellites for the UCLA Acid Test, scheduled for March 19. "The great idea
   still kept us together"-and Norman, Cassady, Hagen, Paul Foster, Roy
   Seburn, Marge and a couple others made a stab at preparing for the UCLA
   Test. But UCLA backed out of the deal because of the notoriety after the
   Watts Test, and that did it. All began drifting off. It was a strange time
   and a strange feeling. Nobody could figure why Babbs had pranked Cassady;
   the others maybe--although that Hagen would get pranked was pretty
   strange, too-but Cassady-that was unbelievable.

   Cassady said fuck it and headed for San Francisco. Norman and Paul Foster
   went to stay at Hugh Romney's. Then by and by Norman got a chance to go to
   New York with Marge the Barge and Evan Engber, so they headed east by car.

   "HARDLY HAD LEO LEFT US, WHEN FAITH AND CONCORD amongst us was at an end;
   it was as if the life-blood of our group flowed away from an invisible
   wound."

   One day Paul Foster cranked up the great God Rotor and sat down and worked
   on a very intricate illuminated billhead. When he got through, there was
   an ornate black border, and in the middle the words

                                  In Memoriam

   in florid Old English lettering, and at the bottom: January 23, 1966, the
   day Kesey disappeared. Nothing else, just In Memoriam and the date. He
   hung it up on the wall.

                                    chapter

                                      XXI

                                  The Fugitive

   HAUL ASS, KESEY. MOVE. SCRAM. SPLIT FLEE HIDE VANISH DISINTE-grate. Like
   run.

   Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrevrevrevrevrevrevrevrevrevrev or are we gonna have
   just a late Mexican re-run of the scene on the rooftop in San Francisco
   and sit here with the motor spinning and watch with fascination while the
   cops they climb up once again to come git you-

   They just opened the door down below, Rotor Rooter, so

   YOU HAVE MAYBE 45 SECONDS ASSUMING THEY BE SLOW AND SNEAKY AND SURE ABOUT
   IT

   Kesey sits in a little upper room in the last house down the beach, $80 a
   month, on paradise-blue Bandarias Bay, in Puerto Vallarta, on the west
   coast of Mexico, state of Jalisco, one step from the floppy green fronds
   of the jungle, wherein flourish lush steamy baboon lusts of paranoia-Kesey
   sits in this little rickety upper room with his elbow on a table and his
   forearm standing up perpendicular and in the palm of his hand a little
   mirror, so that his forearm and the mirror are like a big rear-view mirror
   stanchion on the side of a truck and thus he can look out the window and
   see them but they can't see him-

   Come on, man, do you need a copy of the script to see how THIS MOVIE GOES?
   You HAVE MAYBE 40 SECONDS LEFT BEFORE THEY COME GET YOU

   -a Volkswagen has been cruising up and down the street for no earthly
   reason at all, except that they are obviously working with the fake
   telephone linesmen outside the window who whistle-

   There they go again

   -whistle in the slow-brain brown Mexican huarache day-laborer way, for no
   earthly reason except that they are obviously synched in, finked in, with
   the Volkswagen. Now a tan sedan comes along the street, minus a license
   plate but plus a stenciled white number-exactly like a prison
   stencil-police and two coat-less guys inside, both in white shirts so
   they're not prisoners-

   one turned looked back !

   If you were watching all this on a movie screen you know  what your
   reaction would be through a mouthful of popcorn from the third row: "what
   more do you need, you dolt! Scream outta there ..."

   -But he has just hooked down five dexedrines and the old motor is spinning
   and rushing most nice and euphorically in fascination and a man can't
   depart this nice $80-a-month snug harbor on paradise-blue Bandarias Bay
   just yet with a cool creek of speed rush in his veins. It is such a tiny
   little fink scene as he sees it in the hand mirror. He can tilt it and see
   his own face entropied with the strain and then tilt it-a sign!-a sparrow,
   fat and sleek, dives through the dwindling sun into a hole in one of the
   lampposts; home.

   More telefono trucks! Two loud whistles this time-for no earthly reason
   except to come git you. You have maybe 35 seconds left

   -Kesey has Cornel Wilde Running Jacket ready hanging on the wall, a
   jungle-jim corduroy jacket stashed with fishing line, a knife, money, DDT,
   tablet, ball-points, flashlight, and grass. Has it timed by test runs that
   he can be out the window, down through a hole in the roof below, down a
   drain pipe, over a wall and into thickest jungle in 45 seconds-well, only
   35 seconds left, but head start is all that's needed, with the element of
   surprise. Besides, it's so fascinating to be here in subastral projection
   with the cool rushing dex, synched into their minds and his own, in all
   its surges and tributaries and convolutions, turning it this way and that
   and rationalizing the situation for the 100th time in split seconds, such
   as: If they have that many men already here, the phony telephone men, the
   cops in the tan car, the cops in the Volkswagen, what are they waiting
   for? why haven't they crashed right in through the rotten doors of this
   Rat building- But he gets the signal even before he finishes the question:

   Waiting! They know they've got you, fool, have known for weeks. But
   they're certain you're connected with all the lsd being smuggled up from
   mexico and they want to take in as big a haul as possible when they
   finally slam it. Like Leary; they must have been watching a dreadful long
   time before they were content they had something worth his size. Thirty
   years. For a Harvard doctor with grass. That's how bad they wanted the
   whole business locked away. That's how dangerous they consider the whole
   business. And they were completely correct - if not in their fantasy, then
   at least in their evaluation of the present and ever-growing psychedelic
   threat

   a noise down below.

   Them?

   30 segundos left?

   -maybe it's Black Maria, come back with good things for eating and stuff
   for the new disguise, Steve Lamb, mild-mannered reporter and all-around
   creep-

   Run, fool!

   -Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Such a quiet secret muffled smile will be on Black
   Maria's face.

   Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrevrevrevrevrevrevrevrevrevrev It could have been all so
   quiet, just him and Zonker and the smoldering Black Maria in this
   $80-a-month paradise-blue Bandarias Bay in Puerto Vallarta. If the suicide
   ruse and the rest of the main Fugitive fantasy had but worked.

   The trip into Mexico was easy, because everything with Boise was easy.
   Boise always knew. They picked up Zonker in L.A., and then Jim Fish, and
   they coasted on over the line at Tijuana. No hassle to cross over into
   Mexico. The border at Tijuana is like a huge superhighway toll station, a
   huge concrete apron and ten or fifteen customs booths in a row for all the
   cars pouring over into Tijuana from San Diego and points north, all
   plastic green and concrete like part of suburban superhighway America. So
   they rolled on over the line with Kesey hidden in the back of Boise's old
   panel truck and heart don't even thump too bad. Spirits up, a little of
   the Prankster elan back in the cosmos. In true Prankster fashion they
   spent one third their money stash on a Madman Muntz autostereo rig to go
   along with all the other valuables, like tape recorders and many tapes.

   The next likely hassle is visas, because this shapes up as a long stay.
   Might be hot to try to get Kesey one in Tijuana, because Tijuana is just a
   California annex, really, the slums of San Diego, and they just might very
   well know about the case.

   "We'll do it in Sonoita, man," says Boise. "They don't give a shit there.
   Put down a couple of bucks and they can't see anything else."

   Sonoita is almost due east of Tijuana, just south of the Arizona border.
   Kesey uses his good shuck ID there and all is jake in Sonoita.
   Fugitive!-real-life and for sure now.

   Then south down so-called Route 2 and so-called Route 15, bouncing and
   grinding along through the brown dust and scrawny chickens and animal dung
   brown dust fumes of western Mexico, towns of Coyote, Caborca, Santa Ana,
   Querobabi, Cornelio, El Oasis, hee, Hermosillo, hah, Pocitos Casas,
   Cieneguito, Guaymas, Camaxtli, Mixcoatl, Tlazolteotl, Quetzalcoatl,
   Huitzilopochtli, Tezcatlipoca haunting the Dairy Queen Rat Queen
   crossroads in the guise of a Rat, a Popoluactli-screeing rat, Tetzcotl,
   Yaotl, Titlacahuan he whose slaves we are, Ochpaniiztl priesty
   Angel-freaked out in a motorcycle made from the vaseline skin of Gang Bang
   Girl Meets White Trash ... A confetti of skulls and death in western
   Mexico, the Rat lands. Not one inch of it is picturesque burros and shawls
   or nova Zapata hats or color-TV pink chunks of watermelon or water lilies
   or gold feathers or long eyelashes or high combs or tortillas and tacos
   and chili powder or fluty camote vendors or muletas or toreros or oles or
   mariachi bands or water lilies or blood of the dahlia or tinny cantinas or
   serapes or movie black marias with shiny black hair and steaming little
   high round pubescent bottoms. None of the old Mexico we know and love on
   the 21-day excursion fare. Just the boogering brown dust and bloated rat
   corpses by the road, goats, cows, chickens with all four feet up in the
   air at the Tezcatlipocan skull rot crossroads of Mexico.

   To Kesey it was a hopeless flea-bitten desert he was fleeing into. But
   Boise made it bearable. Boise always knew. Boise was wizened and
   thin-faced and he had the awfulest New England high flat whine, and he
   didn't belong anywhere near here, but he was here, now, and he knew. The
   truck breaks down for the fourteenth time-

   "No hassle, man. We just back it up on a rock, man ... Then we just take
   the tire off and fix it."

   More flat, Rat country, mosquito and flea, into total nothing, like the
   lines of perspective in a surrealist painting, but Boise makes you realize
   it is all the same, here as anywhere. Boise lecherously scanning the
   streets as they bounce through the dead chicken towns just like it was
   only Saturday night on Broadway in North Beach, spotting a good looking
   gringa muchacha padding along the side of the road with honest calves,

   25 SECONDS LEFT, FOOL!

   and he says, "Shall we get her over and ball her, man?" all in the same
   New England whine, as if he were saying, Wanna Coke, or not? Kesey looks
   at Boise's lined face and his thin lips, looks ancient, only a glitter
   comes out of the eyes, nice and lecherous, dead certain and crazy alive at
   the same time. And Boise in that moment is in the tiny knot of Perfect
   Pranksters, the inner circle, ascending into the sangha for good.

   In Guaymas, on the gulf, Jim Fish wants out. An early attack of paranoia,
   Jim Fish? and catches a bus back to the U.S., leaving Kesey, Boise and
   Zonker and the equipment. But was it not ever so? You're either on the bus
   or off the bus. Kesey's spirits were picking up. Boise was pulling
   everything together ::: this crazy New Englander is here in these Rat
   lands.

   "Hey, man ..." Boise points at a construction scene they're going by. "...
   see that?" as if to say, There's the whole thing, right there.

   A whole gang of workmen are trying to put the stucco on the ceiling of a
   building they're finishing up. One fat man is mixing up the stucco in a
   washtub. One skinny one is scooping the stucco up out of the tub with a
   little trowel and pitching it up underhanded at the ceiling. A little of
   it sticks-and three or four guys stand on a plank scaffolding taking stabs
   at smoothing it out-but most of it falls down on the floor and three or
   four more are hunkered down there scraping it up off the floor and
   shoveling it back in the tub and the skinny guy skinnies up another little
   gob with his skinny trowel and they all stare again to see what happens.
   They are all hunkering around in huaraches, worthless flat Rat woven
   sandals, up on the scaffolding, down on the floor, waiting to see what
   happens, how fate brings it off with this little gob of nothing pitched up
   at the Rat expanse .. .

   And it's all there-the whole Mexico Trip-

   "They have a saying, 'Hay tiemp-' " Boise hooks the steering wheel to get
   around an ice-cream vendor in the middle of the road " '-o,' 'There is
   time.' "

   20 SECONDS, IDIOT!

   Huaraches, which are the Rat shoe. It all synches. Mexico is the Rat
   paradise. But of course! It is not worthless-it is perfection. It is as if
   the Rat things of all the Rat lands of America, all the drive-ins,
   mobile-home parks, Dairy Queens, superettes, Sunset Strips, auto-accessory
   stores, septic-tank developments, souvenir shops, snack bars, lay-away
   furniture stores, Daveniter living rooms, hot-plate hotels, bus-station
   paperback racks, luncheonette in-the-booth jukebox slots, raw-concrete
   service-station toilets with a head of urine in the bowl, Greyhound bus
   toilettes with paper towels and vomit hanging over the hockey-puckblack
   rim, Army-Navy stores with Bikini Kodpiece Briefs for men, Super Giant
   racks with matching green twill shirts and balloon-bottom pants for honest
   toilers, $8,000 bungalows with plastic accordion-folding partitions and
   the baby asleep in there in a foldaway crib of plastic net, picnic tables
   with the benches built onto them used in the dining room, Jonni-Trot
   Bar-B-Q sandwiches with a carbonated fruit drink, aluminum slat awnings,
   aluminum sidings, lukewarm coffee-"with" in a china mug with a pale brown
   pool in the saucer and a few ashes, a spade counter chef scraping a
   short-order grill with a chalky Kitchy-Brik and he won't take your order
   till he's through, a first-come-first-serve doctor's waiting room with
   modest charwomen with their dresses stuck on the seats of shiny vinyl
   chairs and they won't move to get loose for fear you'll look Up their
   dress, plaid car coats from Sears and a canvas cap with a bill, synthetic
   dresses for waitresses looking like milky cellophane, Rat cones, Rat
   sodas, Rat meat-salad sandwiches, Rat cheezis, Rat-burgers-it is as if the
   Rat things of all the Rat lands of America had been looking for their
   country, their Canaan, their Is-ra-el, and they found it in Mexico. It has
   its own Rat aesthetic. It's hulking beautiful...

   Then they reached Mazatlan, the first full-fledged resort you reach on the
   west coast of Mexico, coming down from the States. Everybody's trip was
   fishing in Mazatlan. Along the old Avenida

   del Mar and the Paseo Claussen, white walls with nice artistic Rat fishing
   scenes and hotel archways with great shiny blue martins hanging inside the
   arches and gringos with duckbill caps here to catch some marlin. Mariachi
   music at last, with the trumpets always breaking and dropping off the note
   and then struggling up again. Zonker has the bright idea of going to
   O'Brien's Bar, on the beach front, place he got beat up out back of once
   by thirteen Mexican fags. Zonker enjoys revisiting scenes of previous
   debacles. Like also spends hours on the beach telling them how his true
   and fiercest fear is of being attacked by a shark while swimming . . . as
   he picks flea-bite scabs until his legs stream blood to the luscious
   world. . . then goes swimming.

   O'Brien's brings on the paranoia right away. It is a break in the Rat
   movie. It is dark and a Mexican band plays-signaling to the Rat
   sensibility that it will cost too much. Rat souls everywhere fear dark,
   picturesque restaurant, knowing instinctively they will pay dearly for the
   bullshit ambiance, dollar a drink probably. O'Brien's was crowded, and
   then through the cocktail gloom: heads. A bunch of kids with the
   jesuschrist hair, the temple bells and donkey beads, serape vests,
   mandalas; in short, American heads. Zonker recognizes them immediately.
   They're not only American heads, but from San Jose, and some had been to
   the Acid Tests. Just what the Fugitive needs to blow the whole suicide
   ruse. "Guess who I saw in Mexico..." Naturally, Zonk, with his zest for
   debacle, hails them over. Kesey is introduced as "Joe," and nobody pays
   him much mind except for one dark little girl, Mexican-looking, with long
   black hair.

   "When were you born?" she says to Kesey. She doesn't sound Mexican. She
   sounds like Lauren Bacall speaking through a tube.

   "I'm a Virgo." No sense hitting a ball three bits you can see coming if
   you can cut across the fourth.

   "I thought so. I'm a Scorpio."

   "Beautiful."

   The black Scorpio obviously knows Zonk best. She knows him when. But Zonk
   belongs to the ages and it comes to pass that Zonk or no Zonk, she and
   Kesey relax out in the open air on the pier one night down by a Mazatlan
   Rat beach, all dirt and scrabble, but the waves and the wind and the
   harbor lights do it up right and the moon hits some kind of concrete shaft
   there, putting her in the dark, in the shadow, and him in the light, lit
   up by the moon, as if some designer drew a line precisely between their
   bodies. Blacky Maria, he decides.

   So Black Maria joins the Fugitive band and they go off to Puerto Vallarta.
   Puerto Vallarta is out of the Rat lands. All picture-book Mexico.
   Paradise-blue Bandarias Bay and a pure white beach and white latino
   collages right up against the jungle, which is a deep raw green, and
   clean. Fat green fronds lapping up against the back of the houses on the
   beach. Macaw sounds, or very near it. Secret poisonous orchid and orange
   pops and petals winking out when the foliage moves. A nice romantic Gothic
   jungle. Zonker hassles with an oily little real-estate man and gets the
   last house on the edge of town for $80 a month. The rent is low because
   the jungle is too close for the tourists, the jungle and too many Mexican
   kids and chickens and the rural dung dust. Boise heads back to the U.S.
   and Kesey, Zonker and Black Maria move in. They have the upper half of the
   house, one floor and a spiral staircase up to the roof. Up on the roof is
   a kind of thatched hut, the highest perch around, a perfect lookout post
   and a snug harbor. Kesey decides to risk a phone call to the States to let
   Faye and everybody know he's O.K. He goes into town and calls Peter Demma
   in the Hip Pocket Book Store in Santa Cruz. A little metallic clanking
   about by the telefonista senoritas down at central. And then,

   "Peter?"

   From many Rat miles away: "Ken!" Very surprised, naturally ...

   So Kesey whiled the time sitting in the snug hacienda on the edge of
   Puerto Vallarta sipping beer and smoking many joints

   and writing in a notebook occasionally. He wanted to get a little of all
   this down and send ii to Larry McMurtry.

   "Larry:

   "Phone calls to the states eight bucks apiece besides was ever a good
   board to bound my favorite ball of bullshit prose offen, it was you ..."

   Like all about Black Maria. In many ways she was so great. She is quiet
   and has a kind of broody beauty. She cooks. She looks Mex and speaks Mex.
   She can even hassle Mex. She sounds out the Mayor of Puerto Vallarta as to
   how safe Kesey will be here in town. Hay tiempo, he says. The extradition
   takes forever. Very nice to know . ..

   And yet Black Maria is not completely a Prankster. She wants to be a part
   of all this, she wants to do this thing, but she does it without belief.
   It is like the Mexican part of her Black Maria thing. She has all the
   trappings of Mexican-she looks it, she speaks it, her grandfather was even
   Mexican-but she is not Mexican. She is Carolyn Hannah of San Jose,
   California, under everything else, even the blood. He wrote in the
   notebook::Meving the dark Indian

   10 SECONDS LEFT, YOU FREAKING EE-JOT! ! ! !

   body out of the Indian land weakened the Indian blood with chicken soup
   and matzoh balls. So much of the fire concealed by the dark and broody
   beauty lies just that deep. Because she does it without belief. And yet it
   is very nice up here in this thatched perch atop the last house. A car
   heads up the street-Zonker and Black Maria coming back to the house. He
   peers over the edge at the car kicking up the dust, then writes in the
   notebook, it is a perfect lookout, allowing me to see them, without them
   seeing me. Many things. .. synch.

   ZONKER AND BLACK MARIA DROVE DOWN THE ROAD, Scattering up the kids and the
   chickens and the dust, and Black Maria pointed up to the top of the house
   and said to Zonker:

   "Look, there's Kesey." Then she looked out the window and stared at the
   jungle. "I bet he thinks we can't see him."

   THE JIG IS UP. ZONKER BRINGS A TELEGRAM FROM PAUL Robertson back in San
   Jose and it is a bear. It is not even a warning, it

   5 SECONDS - 5 SECONDS LEFT - YOU REALLY JES GON' SIT THERE FOR THE SQUASH?

   is final. The jig is up, is says. Meaning, it turned out, that the suicide
   ruse had been exposed and the cops knew he was in Puerto Vallarta.
   Exposed?-hell, the suicide prank had turned into a goddamn comic opera.
   For a start, Dee had pulled a sort of Dee-out, as Mountain Girl feared.
   Dee had driven up looking for a cliff near Humboldt Bay, about 250 miles
   north of San Francisco, up near Eureka, California, not far from the
   Oregon border in redwoods country. He got up to the last hill going up
   there and the panel truck wouldn't pull the hill. So he called into town
   for a tow truck and the garage man and the tow truck pulled the suicide
   vehicle up the last mile. Hired and paid for and thanks a lot. Always nice
   to hire some help to commit suicide. Next Dee dropped Kesey's distinctive
   sky-blue boots down to the shore below-but they hit the water instead and
   sank without a bubble. Next, the goddamned romantic suicide desolate
   foaming cliff was so goddamned desolate, nobody noticed the truck for
   about two weeks, despite the Ira Sandperl for President sign on the rear
   bumper. Apparently people figured the old heap had been abandoned. The
   Humboldt county police finally checked it out on February 11. Next, the
   suicide note, which seemed so ineluctably convincing as Kesey and Mountain
   Girl smoked a few joints and

   soared into passages of Shelleyan Weltschmerz-it gave off a giddy scent of
   put-on, even to the straight cops of the Humboldt. There were certain
   inconsistencies. Like the part about the truck smashing into a redwood.
   Well-even in a Dee-out, Dee couldn't exactly ask the tow-truck man, Well,
   now that you've towed it up here, how about jamming it into a tree for me.
   Demma had really been bowled over to hear from Kesey. A lot of people, a
   lot of people who liked him, had really been worried that he was dead. And
   now here was Kesey calling him-alive-with a message for Faye and the whole
   thing. That was Saturday. The next night, Sunday, February 13, Demma
   dropped into Manuel's Mexican Restaurant in Santa Cruz, and there was his
   old friend Bob Levy. By way of making conversation, Levy says,

   "What have you heard from Ken?"

   "I just got a call from him!" says Demma. "From Puerto Vallarta!"

   That's interesting.

   Levy happened to be a reporter for the Watsonville Register-Pajaronian,
   Watsonville being a town near Santa Cruz. The next afternoon, Monday, the
   lead story in the Watsonville Register-Pajaronian carried a five-column
   headline reading:

                      MISSING NOVELIST TURNS UP IN MEXICO

   The next day, Tuesday, the San Jose Mercury picked up the story and put a
   little more spin on it with a story headlined:

                Kesey's corpse having a ball in puerto vallarta

   A MOMENT LATER BLACK MARIA WALKED INTO THE Apartment. She found Kesey gone
   and the Cornel Wilde jungle running jacket gone. That trip again. Well,
   he'll come back when he's ready to, worn out, and things will be cool for
   a while. Kesey had gotten paranoid as hell, but that wasn't the only
   thing. He liked this Fugitive game. Man, he'd scram out in the jungle and
   hide out there for two or three days and smoke a lot of grass and finally
   straggle in. That started before the telegram even. There was a whole
   signal they worked out. Or he worked out. When the coast was clear, she
   was supposed to hang up a yellow shirt of Zonk's on the line outside the
   back window, facing the jungle. It was a yellow shirt with a black and
   brown print on it, on the faggy side, if you asked Black Maria. The flag
   would go up and finally Kesey would straggle back home beat, having run
   himself about to death in the jungle or along the beach.

   And yet it was nice. It was crazy but nice. Kesey was the most magnetic
   person she had ever met. He radiated something, a kind of power. His
   thoughts, the things he talked about, were very complex and metaphysical
   and cryptic but his manner was back-home, almost back-country. Even while
   he was reeking with paranoia, he seemed to have total confidence. That was
   very strange. He could make you feel like part of something very ... He
   had even given her a new name, Black Maria. She was. .. Black Maria.

   As a girl in San Jose, California, she had felt like everything she really
   was had been smothered under layers and layers of games she couldn't
   control. Externally there was nothing wrong. Her father and mother were
   both teachers and life in San Jose was comfortable and serene in the
   California suburban manner. But half the time nobody ever understands
   about growing up in this country. Little Penguin Islands full of kids
   playing Lord of the Flies, a world of pygmy tribes, invisible to the
   Isfahan adult eye, these little devils, tribes of studs, tribes of rakes,
   tribes of IntelFinks even, tribes of greasers, and an amorphous mass of
   hopeless cases left over. Until-psychedelics started around there, mainly
   grass and acid. The new scene started and suddenly all sorts of. . . well,
   beautiful people blossomed forth from out of the polyglot, people who
   really had a lot to them, only it had been smothered by all the eternal
   social games that had been set up. Suddenly they found each other.

   One night she was high and experienced the unity, the All-one. A light was
   behind her in the room and hit her body from behind and broke up into
   beams and shone out before her, hitting the floor and the walls in spokes
   of light with shadows in between. The room broke up before her eyes and
   separated in just that pattern with bars of light vibrating. Suddenly it
   became very clear, the way the room was put together, the way the parts
   fit, the way the parts of everything fit, as if someone had taken an
   Indian puzzle ring apart for her. It was clear how everything fit together
   and it wasn't really a world split up into pointless games and cliques.
   That was merely the way it looked before you knew the key. And now there
   were beautiful people who knew the key and this experience could be
   shared.

   Her mother gave her money for the second semester at San Jose State, and
   although it would hurt her mother at first, she knew what she had to do.
   She took the money and headed off to Mexico with some beautiful kids. It
   was a little more complicated than that. She knew Zonk at San Jose State
   and she knew he was heading for Mexico, for Mazatlan, although she didn't
   know about the Kesey prank, and so she was following Zonk, for if there
   were beautiful people, Zonk was one of them.

   Mazatlan was just beginning to be the acid heads' favorite spot on the
   Mexican west coast. It wasn't a place the real hard-core tourists were
   onto yet. They went on down the coast to Acapulco, generally. At the same
   time Mazatlan wasn't so unbearably Mexicali... sad... like the true Acid
   Central of Mexico, Ajijic, on Lake Chapala. Those poor sad Lake Chapala
   villages, Ajijic, Chapala, Jocotepec, with the lake drying up and the old
   suck-smack lily-pad scum mud showing and failed American aesthetes padding
   around earnestly in sandals, 48-year-old bohos sucking up to young heads
   of the new generation of Hip. Very sad. It is truly a sad thing when an
   American boho says fuck this and picks up and leaves this fucking tailfin
   and shopping plaza and war-crazy civilization and goes to live among real
   people, the honest folk-type folk, in the land of Earth feelings, Mexico,
   and the hell with tile baths-and then he sits there, in Mexico, amid the
   hunkering hardcheese mestizos, and, man, it is honest and real here .. .
   and just as miserable as hell, and he is a miserable aging fuckup with no
   place else to go.

   But Mazatlan-the head scene there was a happy thing and a groove. So she
   sat down in Mazatlan and wrote her mother a Beautiful People letter ...

   And she found Zonk and, unexpectedly, the famous Ken Kesey and beautiful
   people. But one thing about the beautiful people themselves-Namely, the
   Merry Pranksters. She had heard

   of the fabulous Merry Pranksters even in San Jose. Kesey and Zonk talked
   about them all the time, of course. The fabulous Babbs, the fabulous
   Mountain Girl, the fabulous Cassady, Hermit, Hassler and the rest. She had
   a Prankster name, Black Maria, but she was not yet a Prankster. She was
   sensitive even to the contours of Kesey's world, too. Sooner or later
   Kesey would reunite with the Pranksters. ..

   Well. .. put out Zonker's shirt when the coast is clear. Zonker's billowy
   faggy-looking shirt. Let him stay out on his jungle run for a while. If he
   enjoys the Fugitive game, why spoil it.

   Shhhhhhhhhhwaaaaaaaaap

   flopping lush P.V. fronds Kesey thrashes out of the jungle and across the
   road-

   Cars? one Mex one American coming in pale tan VW? no, no cars, man, and
   then down across the road to rocky scrabble down by the ocean on the
   rocks, his heart rattling away, he sinks down in his Cornel Wilde running
   jacket listening

   whop!

   surf hits the rocks, just a little holiday in picturesque P.V. with the
   sea kicking up at twilight. He concentrates on the surf-analogy spoken
   here?-but the surf is too aimless this way. His heart rattles tachycardiac
   at this speed, and the surf is synched in to another thing WHOPping
   against the rocks

   Branngggh

   a tin-door sound up on the road like the ominous tin-car-door sounds in
   Hud always bring on the bad action-like brown Mex and crewcut drip-dry
   American up on the road eyes rocketing around, Brown Mex puffing
   I'm-supposed-to-be-off-duty-now-senor. Kesey faces out to sea, pulls a
   tablet out of the jacket. Makes the pink cover visible as if to prove just
   an aimless surf artist drawing water swells furl by furl like Leonardo who
   must have been a head, all the minute instincts, to sit by the water
   drawing the little furls as the water laps up on beach then starts rolling
   back toward the sea and minute little churning furls in the lead edge of
   the water, he drew it all, furl by furl, like a very meth head plugged
   into the great God Rotor. More surf, then

   Kaboom!

   first-they're FIRING on him. They don't give a shit.

   Hot pursuit!

   we got the guns and the rights, signed on this piece of paper here, one
   move blow yr fucking head off and you have already moved, Kesey-

   Hot pursuit!

   Kaboom!

   but nothing happens. Silence except for the surf.

   That is very paranoid, hondo why would they try to blast you out of the
   tub with elephant guns anyway. It must be workmen using dynamite. So he
   edges up to the road and it is workmen all right, sweating and heaving
   while the green fronds flap up the hill. He'll just sit here and

   watch them dynamite

   SURE

   just watch them dynamite while every gringo car comes spinning off the
   shore drive out here Baskin-Robbins tourist matron lookout and say "Hey,
   Honey, that's Ken Kee-zee..."

   Back into the jungle, Cornel Wilde. Heart still banging up to the edge of
   fibrillation, through the lush shadowy danks of the jungle. Well, yessir,
   lookee here a minute, what's this. A three-sided hut in the jungle, some
   kind of woodsman's hut, with a cot in it and a little hoard of mango
   papaya, some kind of pallid little fruit. He sinks back on the cot, unzips
   his fly to air out his sweating nuts and dips into his jacket and pulls
   out three roaches and wraps a leaf around them like a cone and lights up.
   He cuts open a fruit and it bleeds meek white and he puts it aside.

   A TRAP FOR JUNGLE RUNNERS

   this perfect little snug harbor to suck you in, a hut, a cot, meek milk
   white fruit to eat, a joint of sorts, oh to be back in Baskin-Robbins
   country just one time facing endless beige tubs of ice cream 31 flavor
   decisions to make, pointed cone or cup-style

   !paranoia!

   but this is the real-life jungle, Major. Two-winged flies, dapple-wing
   Anapholes, Culex tarsalis, verruga-crazed Phlebotomus biting 8-day fever
   and Oriental sores, greenhead rabbit-fever horseflies, tularemic Loa loa,
   tsetse mites, Mexican fleas, chinches, chiggers, velvet ants, crab lice
   crawling up your balls up your belly under your arms right up to your
   eyelashes for a nice fix of Mexican murine typhus, puss caterpillars,
   cantharidae beetles, Indian bedbugs, ticks, itch mites nice for scabies
   and rickety pox, Pacific Coast female tick hiding in the hairs at the base
   of the head sucking in the death bloat with blood, paralysis coming up
   from the toes will it reach the lungs before the big blood sausage mother
   drops off, a blood bag with tiny feet wriggling like worm hairs

   DDT!

   he gets down and pulls the DDT can out of the jacket and starts dusting
   all around the ground there around the cot, setting up a mighty defense
   perimeter against the mites of the jungle-which is very funny, come to
   think of it-down on all fours in deadly battle with the microscopic mites
   while

   THEY

   close in to slam you away for five, eight, twenty years... driven at last
   out onto the edge of your professed beliefs. You believed that a man
   should move off his sure center out onto the outer edges, that the outlaw,
   even more than the artist, is he who tests the limits of life and that-The
   Movie :::: by getting totally into Now and paying total Attention until it
   all flows together in the synch and imagining them all into the Movie,
   your will will determine the flow and control all jungles great and small

   Next to last joint in all of Mexico

   he pulls it out of his pocket and lights up. Maybe I'll knock off the
   grass for a while. Su-u-u-ure.

   And then believe all that crap you've been claiming about altering by
   accepting. Believe it! Or you are a goner, and boy, a walking dead man
   forevermore fading finally inaudible LIKE THE VOICES MUMBLING BITONES IN
   THE CATHEDRAL !

   And now that I've got your attention-if he sits very still, the rush
   lowers in his ears, he can concentrate, pay total attention, an even,
   even, even world, flowing into now, no past terrors, no anticipation of
   the future horror, only now, this movie, the vibrating parallel rods, and
   he can feel them drawn into the flow, his, every verruga fly, velvet ant,
   murine fleas and crabs, every chinch and tick, every lizard, cat, palm,
   the very power of the most ancient palm, held in his will, and he is
   immune-

   MOUNTAIN GIRL STUCK IT OUT WITH BABBS, GRETCH, Walker-for the sake of the
   great idea-and she meant it-but any way she thought it out, it came out
   Kesey. Mountain Girl was almost eight months pregnant now. The bus, The
   Movie, was at a total standstill now, sinking into the swamper bogs. One
   day a package came in by mail, from Mexico, a tape, from Kesey, to
   Mountain Girl. And there was his voice. She could hardly make out a word
   he said, the quality of the tape was so bad-all she could make out was, he
   was in the jungle somewhere and paranoid as hell and smoking a lot of
   grass.

   O dear dead one!

   Then Babbs made the decision to take the bus to Mexico. They were a little
   paranoid themselves, about the heat put on the Acid Tests. Two days after
   the story broke about Kesey being in Puerto Vallarta, the good fink
   California press ran another big one: Kesey's pals in LSD party in L.A. -
   a barnburner about the Watts Test. But mainly they couldn't hack it any
   more; not even Babbs. Get the goddamn bus moving, that was the main thing.

   Mountain Girl had one more ordeal to go through. She had to stand trial in
   San Francisco for possession of marijuana, result of the bust on the
   rooftop. All the shit in society that the Pranksters had liberated
   themselves from through years of arduous initiation-the shit rolled in, in
   lava gulps. She had to sit there, great with child, like a prisoner of war
   in a bamboo' cage, while the straight world put her on prize exhibit and
   clucked and remonstrated and scolded and then shook its head and blubbered
   a little over her. Doped, seduced and abandoned, the poor miscreant
   teenager. She got a little Prankster mileage out of it even then, although
   she had to play it fairly straight, just to let them play out their game
   so she could get on with it. Their fantasy for her was a new dawn for this
   unfortunate girl, not a beeline for Mexico, but that was their fantasy.

   Mountain Girl showed up in court on March 20 in a red dress, four inches
   above the knees, and this was long before mini-dresses were on every
   eyeball, and pregnant as hell. She came to court on the arm of the
   Cavalier Hassler. Hassler was great throughout the whole thing. He was her
   sanity. Hassler came to court with her, wearing a green velveteen shirt,
   yellow boucle stretch pants and red boots, and when the reporters came up
   slavering for sob stuff, he put them on so righteously, it was beautiful.

   "We must do everything possible," he would say, peering out as sincere as
   the Student Council president from under his Prince Valiant locks, "to get
   Carolyn on her feet and out of this life of crime"-Carolyn Adams,
   naturally, being the fantasy that the Court knew her by. "I'm going to be
   the strong stabilizing force in her life"-vibrating yellow and green.
   "She's had a lot of misjudgment."

   "My misjudgment may extend to you," said Mountain Girl. Great fun had by
   all.

   The sob-story angle was the fantasy they all came up with for

   her in court, her lawyer included. It was like they had all looked at her
   and thought it over and hmmmmmmmm this poor misguided runaway girl 20
   years old, lately a teenager, you understand, and more than seven months
   in the family way seduction by the demon Kesey who left her to take the
   whole blame for the dope charge as well as abandoning her with an unborn
   child. Urgggggggggghhhhhh the prosecutor agreed on it, her lawyer agreed
   on it, the Judge agreed on it. So went the Justice game. And where was the
   demon Kesey who left so fast breathing dope from every nostril-it was as
   if everybody was going to be nice to her by way of pointing out the lesson
   of Kesey's evil.

   Her lawyer, Steven Dedina, said: "Carolyn is no dope fiend, no dope
   addict. Her one addiction is a perennial overdose of solicitude for
   persons who are far away. Were it not for that particular addiction, this
   defendant would not be standing in this particular place at this
   particular time."

   So on March 22 Mountain Girl was let off with a fine of $250 for
   possession of marijuana. Yet if Kesey had left her in a lurch, it was a
   lurch that they would never understand in a million years.

   THE TRIP DOWN INTO MEXICO WAS THE BUS AT ITS MOST Awful. Mountain Girl, so
   pregnant, just held on and forced back the bilious as the thing bounced
   and pitched and rolled through the desert. She felt like a 200-pound egg.
   But moving again! that was the main thing. Anything was better than what
   she had been going through. And this was truly something. Every 20 miles
   it seemed like the bus broke down and Babbs sweated over it. All the
   vibrations outside were bad. Corpses, chiefly. Scrub cactus, brown dung
   dust and bloated corpses, dogs, coyotes, armadillos, a cow, all
   gas-bellied and dead, swollen and dead, Babbs, Gretch, Faye and the kids,
   Walker and Mountain Girl.

   The fantasy this time had been dreamed up by Zonker. Zonker had gotten in
   touch with them, and Hagen had already driven down in an old car. Now the
   bus was going to keep a secret rendezvous with them in Mazatlan. Kesey had
   lit out for Mazatlan after the big scare in Puerto Vallarta.

   In Puerto Vallarta, Kesey had sure enough had something to worry about
   after all. Chief Arturo Martinez Garza of the Mexican Federales had
   ordered a search of Puerto Vallarta on February 16, two days after the
   story broke in the California papers. They had hassled all strange
   bohemian-looking Americans on the streets and so on. But Kesey had already
   made a run for it, back to Mazatlan. Zonker had arranged the rendezvous
   for the beach at Mazatlan, such-and-such a day, such-and-such an hour.

   Babbs flogged the bus through the corpse horizon day and night, desperate
   to make it on time, with the bus breaking down over and over again,
   everybody ill, not just Mountain Girl, but flogging on like it was life or
   death. And finally, Mazatlan, the sea, the big curve of the malecon-they
   made it. This was the flow, and it was a sickening horrible flow, but they
   had made it, and they tooled up to the rendezvous point-no Kesey. No
   Zonker and no Hagen.

   It was too much, this particular predictable fuckup, after all that. It
   wasn't a cool thing for them to just sit there by the beach in this lurid
   freak of a bus, such as Mexico had never seen, but this was too much, and
   they sat there, beat, and let the hours tool by. They were a hell of a hit
   with the Mexicans, however. They never saw anything like it. "!Diablo!"
   they kept saying. Women hid their children with their skirts. A whole
   bunch of locals gathered around the bus and grinned their hideous
   magenta-gummed native grins and stared at the crazies.

   Heeeee!-an old car with no windows in the mother comes by, slowing down.
   The face at the driver's window, with the incredulous look-Hagen. And that
   old gray head peeking over the window's edge in the back, just peeking
   over ever so gingerly-could it possibly be . .. Hagen stops and gets out.
   Then the back door opens ever so gingerly and out steps a gray-haired soul
   with his head cocked to one side, radiating surprise and appall and not at
   all happy about the Diablo multitudes.

   He has on a hincty washed-out faded tourist sport shirt and balloon-seat
   pants. He walks like a repertory theater shambles. He looks ten or fifteen
   years older, like an old workadaddy on the 21-day plan to Mexico. Ecce
   Fugitive.

   Shee-ut, it's all too freaking absurd, this secret rendezvous. The bus
   glowing Day-Glo on the beach at Mazatlan, the Diablo multitudes whooping
   it up like a cock fight, Mountain Girl beautiful and fulsome with her hair
   down to her waist and dyed yellow from the last Test-they could have sold
   tickets.

   You're looking at the New Super Fugitive, Mountain Girl: Steve
   Lamb-45-year-old gray-haired ninny. Certified I.D.; Zonker's driver's
   license with the Steve Lambrecht doctored to read Steve Lamb and the birth
   date altered to make him 45 instead of 25. Mild-mannered lamb among men,
   Steve Lamb, 45-year-old reporter, creep and amateur ornithologist,
   broadcaster for KSRO, Mighty 590 on your dial. Got his tape recorder right
   here, yessir, for collecting bird calls. Also you never know when the spot
   news will break and the diligent reporter is always ready, even on
   holiday. Old mild-mannered Steve Lamb has learned the secret of
   invisibility, which is to crawl into the rut, the bottomest awfulest part
   of the sunken way society has dug for all those who properly fear her
   might, O Mighty 590.

   But hardly seem worth it, somehow, with the bus beginning to glow in the
   Mexican dusk. !Fuck it! !Diablo! !Cosmo! Let's bull it through, here in
   the Rat lands! Glittering Prankster glances all around. Paint it big
   enough and bright enough and they won't even be able to see it! Kesey and
   Mountain Girl and Babbs and Gretch and Faye and the kids standing here in
   the Rat vistas... and along the edge of the circle a little
   Mexican-looking girl with long black hair just emerged from the old car
   ... Black Maria stares out to sea.

                                    chapter

                                     XXIII

                                  The Red Tide

   FOCKING RED TIDE, MAN, AND EVERYBODY IN MANZANILLO is up tight. Tropic of
   Cancer, heat 110 degrees, no wind, many mosquitoes, and the red tide
   killing the fish. Thousands, tens of thousands focking dead fish floating
   belly up in the red tide. The stench you would not believe, and there is
   something in the air spewed up from the ocean that makes your eyes smart.
   Some people they feel like they have it in the lungs, like the flu. There
   is no greater calamity than the red tide, because we live on the fishing
   here in Manzanillo. Unless it is the American crazies. On top of the red
   tide, appearing like they rose up out of the red tide itself, we have the
   American crazies. Focking plague themselves, riding about in a devilish
   criminal bus. They ride into the plaza, near the great jaracanda tree, in
   a devilish bus covered in crazed fluorescent cholera flowers, gaudier than
   the red blossoms of Manzanillo's great jaracanda tree

   Red tide! and old women and children say, "!Diablo!", and cross
   themselves, which the American crazies think is very funny. We do not,
   however.

   The biggest of them, with a great mocking grin and American lightbulb
   eyeballs and pants of many colors, comes into our marketplace with a blond
   woman whom he calls Gretch and a trail of blond children behind him,
   rolling his grinning head around until he sees that all the world is
   watching, and then he throws his great arms of an ape up into the air and
   turns his eyeballs up and shouts:

   "!Eat alley! !Eat alley! !Take me to eat alley!"

   "You mean the market, senor?"

   Then he grins and stares with an intensity at the poor mestizo as if he
   has just uttered the most penetrating remark in the history of all Mexico
   and says:

   "Yeah! Yeah! Right! Right! Right!"

   And all the world gives way, wondering, as this strange train goes
   escombering into the marketplace.

   There is much talk here about the crazies. Many think that these people
   are Germans, refugees from a cabala that failed. They mistake their
   strange talk for German. Some people think that they are American
   gangsters, in hiding. But I think that they came up out of the red tide.

   !Aguaje!

   In truth! Out in the ocean, where the water was once deepest blue-green,
   or, at worst, yellow-green near the beach, there are now vast streaks of
   reddish water, as if there were a channel cutting through the ocean
   itself, stretching for miles, hot and turbid, thick as mucus. The fish die
   almost at once when they enter it. I have watched a mullet come upon it.
   She swam from the blue-green water into the red tide and suddenly she is
   keeling over, as if paralyzed, then struggling to come upright again, then
   thrashing about crazily as if dizzy, then heading for the surface, where
   she whirls, flashing in the sunlight, then collapses, keeling over on her
   side again, paralyzed, then sinks, and then, by and by, without doubt,
   floats back up, dead, to join the great stinking school of dead fish, dead
   crabs, dead sea bass, mullets, thread herring, mackerel, shrimp, even
   barnacles, coquinas, sailfish, marlin, porpoises, turtles, huge gobs of
   reeking gluey tissue floating in a grisly death school on the red tide.
   Struck dead-

   -by what? By the plankton. All the world knows that the plankton cause the
   red tide-as if that could be called a cause. For the plankton are always
   there, millions of invisible animiculae, thousands to a cupful of
   seawater. It is they who reflect blue-green and give our ocean its color,
   although elsewhere they reflect red and make the Red Sea red, without harm
   to any animal, and the Vermillion Sea vermillion and the Lake of Blood a
   rose-red milk of sulphur. But here, off the placid Bay of Manzanillo in
   the Pacific Ocean, this little invisible ... um ... dinoflagellate,
   Gymnodinium brevis, just one cell to him and two whips, whipping and
   darting about, begins to multiply. And suddenly he appears to explode,
   should one look at him under a microscope, as Charles Darwin once did, and
   he divides into two dinoflagellates, and they divide into four, and so on,
   in a progression of utmost rapidity until there are in truth ten million
   of them in a cup of water, and the water turns red from their red pigment,
   which reflects light, until finally, from the focking millions of
   explosions, a poison as powerful as aconitine gives off into the water-but
   why?-why has it started now, this malignant explosion of the plankton
   into-

   -one vast immortal Group Animicula, fifteen miles long and three miles
   wide, immortal, in truth. The first little Gymnodinium brevis still lives
   just as surely as the 128-billionth as the red tide spreads. For they
   increase simply by cell division. The great marlins die, the porpoises,
   all the creatures of the sea die, and the fishermen die, but the
   Gymnodinium is immortal, the instant brother of every Gymnodinium brevis
   who ever lived, no past, no future, only Now, and immortal, the little
   fockers. No cause, senor, no starting point in time, just the point at
   which your game intersected the 256-octillionth Gymnodinium and all his
   ancestors and successors in old Manzanillo and brought you up tight. We
   know only that yesterday there were fish, and today the fish are dead and
   the poison plankton and the American crazies are alive, and tomorrow we
   must find out the cause and the cure-or could it possibly be that
   yesterday and tomorrow are merely more of Now stretching fifteen miles and
   three miles wide immortal-

   THEN, NOW, ESAU, JUDITH, BASHEMATH, REUEL, SUSPENDED in the mucus; what a
   bummer. Mountain Girl lies on the bed in her room; staring at the ceiling;
   a pisspoor job of plastering it is, too; and all of them suspended in
   110-degree mucus. She; Kesey; Faye; their children; George Walker; the new
   chick, Black Maria; have a house by the beach; new; raw certified Rat
   construction; cinderblock and plaster; she could scrabble through it with
   her hands. Fifty yards away, across the beach road, The Rat Shack; this
   being a Purina Chow factory; yep; inhabited by Babbs, Gretchen Fetchin and
   Babbs's children; a curious little building empty of Purina Chow and
   glistening with tiles inside. All of them gittin stuck and stranded like
   flies in this 110-degree mucus of Manzanillo with the red tide stinking
   the place up for good measure; Hagen, with his leg in a cast; Julius
   Karpin, the Hardest Head in the West, from Berkeley, of the Prankster
   outer circle, here with his leg in a cast. They picked out Manzanillo for
   these very reasons, however; isolated, few Americans in the summer, off
   the tourist trail; secure desert island. Stranded in an uptight town; no
   roads leading north and no roads leading south; nine or ten hours of hell
   by bus to Guadalajara the only way to git back to the rest of the world;
   can't git out in the daytime and do anything because of the heat; can't
   git out at night because of the mosquitoes; the jungle beyond the Rat
   Shack filthy with cocoa palms and all sortsa jungle shit; itching crawling
   alive like a chigger-ridden groin; all manner exotic vermin; sting inflame
   chigger-blister mosquito heaven, with scorpions for good measure coming up
   outta the dung dust like lobsters as the crab louse is to the crab.
   Standing dead still in this shit; jes waiting; for what; for bread,
   mainly; every day in supplication at the altar of the Telegrafo, for money
   from Stateside; Kesey's lawyers supposed to be hassling up money; and
   everyday some soul, like the chick Kesey picked up, Black Maria, down to
   the Telegrafo using an alias waiting for telegrafo coming from some lawyer
   in San Francisco; or from the Mexico City lawyer Kesey's stateside lawyers
   had gotten hold of to straighten things out with the Mexican police; he
   was called Estrella; for Star Lawyer? who the fuck knows; here on Devil's
   Island, us fugitives; no sense of time at all; unbelievable bad news is
   all that filters from the U.S.; Ron Boise, who had a rheumatic heart, has
   died of a heart attack at the age of thirty-two; Norman Hartweg in an
   accident on the drive east with Marge the Barge and Evan Engber, and he is
   in a hospital in Ann Arbor, almost completely paralyzed; unbelievable
   things out of the time-death Karma; and here no time; jes a dead still now
   stretching back eternally and forward eternally.

   So Mountain Girl lies on the bed and stares up through the heat waves
   rising in the 110-degree mucus of Manzanillo; and she is not high on
   anything; maybe slightly out of her head, but not high; no, not even out
   of her head; but it's like that acid time-warp thing; like they're all
   thrust back permanently into a primitive time; this is permanent; Kesey
   can't go back ever; they will slam him away for good; meaning she can't go
   back ever, either; how? back to the bamboo cage to be clucked and lectured
   and blubbered over until she drowned?; none of them can go back; 'cause
   there is nothing to go back to; it is all here now; Mexico, even as Kesey
   foresaw that day in La Honda and she started learning Spanish; which none
   of them really know, however, except Black Maria; always in a cocoon shut
   off from the worthy up-tight nativos; only the Pranksters are the
   primitives; thrown back on their own resources; reliving the primitive
   life of man with only the dwindling hope of a bountiful miracle from the
   sacred Telegrafo to possibly break the spell... of 3,000 years ago.

   Three thousand years ago Mountain Girl walks down to the water, the
   backwater, every day to wash clothes, diapers and sundry other shit; every
   day walking through the heat waves under the salty sun through the scrub
   grass and dung sand, to wash clothes, by the waters of the ... Nile and
   the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her
   maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among
   the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it... it is as if she is walking
   down to the river and she is watching herself, a maiden, 3,000 years ago,
   walking down to the river, at the same time, in ... the Middle East; it is
   always the Middle East somehow, out of an old illustrated Bible; 110
   degrees, bulrushes and the eternal laundry bummer; nothing to read here
   but The Nova Express by William Burroughs; the Nietzsche and Dostoevsky
   that Kesey has; and in the Bible; everybody goes through Nova Express in a
   couple of hours; but the Bible they can linger over ... and gradually
   without anybody hardly saying anything about it, without getting high
   even, they are in another time dimension; biblical tribe, biblical
   tribeswoman washing in the water; living like the children of Isaac and
   Rebecca in the First Book; even taking biblical identities; they each
   choose, become a character in the Bible; in truth; it is 3,000 years ago,
   now stretching back infinitely to ... the very Genesis; to Esau; Kesey is
   Esau; the hairy one; and Esau was a cunning hunter; a man of the field;
   and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents; 13. Did they grow up alike?
   Describe them.-Esau was a skillful hunter, and Jacob was a quiet man, fond
   of home; 14. Which was the first born?-Esau; 15. Did he value his
   birthright? The proof?-He sold it, when hungry, and faint, to Jacob for a
   dish of potted beans or other food. So thousands, for present pleasure,
   will risk or lose their souls; 16. To whom did he sell it, and for
   what?-See No. 15; 23. Whom did Esau choose as his wives?-Judith and
   Bashemath, Hittites. Gen. 26:34.; 24. Did his parents approve his
   choice?-No; they were grieved by it; and Bashemath bore Reuel... 3,000
   years ago; for there is no time in this place; only an eternal now
   stretching on infinitely over the entire world and all the history
   thereof; for the world seeketh its own level; which is the sea; and all
   living creatures of the sea shall die; but the Gymnodinium brevis, which
   knoweth no time, except now, shall live forever; ye have heard that it was
   said by them of old time, The earth is round; but I say unto you . . .

   KESEY WOULD LIE OUTSIDE THE CASA GRANDE IN A HAMMOCK. Black Maria, in
   tight black slacks, would keep brooding, staring out to sea with her back
   to them, which annoyed everyone. They would occasionally snigger slightly,
   which made her more up tight, of course. Julius and Mike Hagen both had
   their casts painted most lurid and glorious Day-Glo in bus designs. Kesey
   lay in the hammock reading Nietzsche :::: who would have thought the old
   whiskered Valkyrie was such a head, into the pudding...

   And little cycles within cycles. Hagen kept repeating traumatic injuries.
   In Barcelona he had a motorcycle accident and kept riding and ended up
   with a permanently injured shoulder. In Canada the same thing all over
   again. And now in Mexico with his broken leg in a Day-Glo cast he felt
   something... grisly . . . under there, and spied a tick, and cut open the
   cast and found two more and pus oozing under the cast. He closed the whole
   thing up by wrapping adhesive around the cast.

   "Why'd you put that tape over your pretty cast, Mike?"

   "Looking for ticks."

   Couple of days later he couldn't even walk as far as the Rat Shack.
   Nothing to do but deliver himself up to the Rat ministry of the Hospital
   Civil.

   "Give me some speed, Julius, so I can deal with the bastards."

   Kesey tries to cheer him up by telling him he can film the forthcoming
   wedding between Mountain Girl and George Walker.

   "Hey!" says Hagen. "Maybe we can get the guy, the mayor jefe, to do the
   ceremony out here."

   Hagen begins to jack-leg around on the cast, snapping his fingers. The
   dexedrine is beginning to stir and tickle at the boy inside the cast.

   "Fuck that," says Mountain Girl.

   "And a lot of flowers!"

   "Fuck that."

   Mountain Girl looks like a great gorgeous Amazon-and very
   down-in-the-mouth, with her lurid Acid Test yellow hair hanging down to
   her waist but a little circle of black on top, like a cap where it is
   coming in natural at the roots. Like Mike, she'll put off the mundane
   bullshit she loathes just so long as possible. We've known for three weeks
   that she'd love to be legally married, for her child to have legal Mexican
   rights and she's known for nine months when that marriage deadline would
   have to be met.

   George, Faye and Zonk come back from the market with food, George wearing
   Zonker's blue velour pants, a shirt with broad orange and white vertical
   stripes, by Gretchen Fetchin, and knee-high boots he has painted in
   diagonal orange and white stripes, and his hair with orange tips from the
   Acid Test lurid bleach. All is arranged at city hall for the marriage,
   Miss Carolyn Adams and Mr. George Walker, and at the Hospital Civil for
   the baby.

   "-and we'll buy a cot of white-"

   "Fuck that."

   "-and we'll film it on the beach at sunset with microphones. Babbs can run
   a cable out and a speaker-and music-we can have Gretch on the organ with
   The Wedding March?'

   "Fuck that," says Mountain Girl.

   SO MOUNTAIN GIRL AND GEORGE WERE MARRIED, QUIETLY, IN town. And Mountain
   Girl had the baby in the Hospital Civil, a healthy blond girl, whom she
   named Sunshine. At sea level...

   Kesey in la casa grande-there's always a taffy triangle being pulled at
   the house, what with four private rooms laced with endless variations on
   the Faye-me-George-Mountain Girl theme.

   Mountain Girl is grimming on: "Look at this wall. It's awful. No, I'm
   serious, look at it. I could scrabble through this wall in five minutes."

   "Whyn't you go roll us a joint?"

   "Can we smoke it in my room so I don't have to keep jumping every time
   Faye bangs the door?"

   "Hmmmm ..."

   "Never mind. That's a tricky question. Besides it keeps me on my toes in
   here."

   SPIRITS PICKING UP SLIGHTLY IN THE RED TIDE TORPOR. Pranksters beginning
   to do small Prankster things. Hagen back from the Hospital Civil hobbling
   but hassling with the old sweet Vesper boy charm. No stereo rigs,
   projectors, video tapes to be hassled hereabouts on Devil's Island, but he
   finds the biggest rig there is and hassles some poor local out of it-a
   turtle. A huge sea turtle, weighs about 50 pounds. Much jubilation over
   the monster, but nobody knows what to do with it, not even Faye, the
   pioneer wife and master cook, dietician, technician and mechanic. No
   caldron they are ever likely to get can deal with it. So they put a huge
   skull and crossbones in Day-Glo on its shell and put it back in the sea,
   thinking happily of another 200 years of life they have assured it. Nobody
   in Zecotopetl death-god Mexico will seek this one for his stewpot...

   Babbs, after many days of glumming in his Purina Chow redoubt, strolls
   over, lewding out, "Hi, Je-e-e-ed!" to Kesey's three-year-old son. Only
   Babbs in his Be-elzebabbs best could greet a three-year-old with such lewd
   lubricious loonacy.

   Page Browning has pulled in, ready to go, enchanted with Huaraches and the
   Rat thing. Huaraches on every foot in Mexico! Zea-lot himself could not
   have devised a more devilish troublesome contrivance.

   "They keep 'em strung out on huaraches! You can't run in 'em, you can't
   walk in 'em, they never fit, they hurt your feet. All you can do is sit
   tight. That's how they keep this country straight. They keep 'em strung
   out on this bummer!" and so on.

   Suddenly-Sandy Lehmann-Haupt turns up, back from way over the edge, on a
   motorcycle. He drove all the way from New York City on this motorcycle,
   halfway across the U.S.A. and all the way through the Rat lands to this
   southwesternmost edge of Mexico, no mean stint even for a Neal Cassady.
   Kesey looks at him and can't believe it. He looks stronger, healthier,
   calmer, more confident than he has ever seen him. It gives him a
   foreboding that he can't put a name on ...

   Even Bob Stone sails in, Bob Stone from way back from old Perry Lane days.
   He pulls in in a Hertz car. He flew into Mexico City, got a Hertz car. He
   has an assignment from Esquire to do a story on Kesey in Exile. Ah; so the
   old world still waits. Stone, still hypersensitive, seeing the FBI and
   Federales behind every cocoa palm-or else scorpions-and in that very
   moment, however, plunging head first, as always, into whatever chaos
   debacle any Prankster cares to dream up, crying lissen this is dangerous
   as he swandives off every handy cliff.

   Hooking down dexedrine. Stone and Babbs go off in Stone's car, high on
   pills, heading up Tepic way, in Rat country. Come back giggling and
   carrying on over weird experience with the Road Animal. They had driven
   through the dung dust, days without sleep and soaring on dex, scrub
   country and burros, and night fell and it got really weird. Stone sees
   little Mex bridges and they become gila monsters, and Babbs sees them,
   too. The road becomes the veriest little tightrope between the no-man's
   land of the monsters, and then all at once the monsters take command of
   the road!-up ahead, the biggest road monster any man has ever seen, so
   huge it straddles the road, like a tarantula with legs 10 feet high, on
   the edges of the road, and its huge filthy body and jaws over the middle
   waiting for food and their car is bearing down toward it, don't dare stop
   and don't dare go on-

   "No! Don't go near it!" shouts Stone.

   "No," says Babbs, "we've got to. We've got to go through it."

   "Through it!!"

   "We've got to," says Babbs. "If we don't, we'll never make any

   progress. "

   Suddenly it seems the most crucial thing in the history of the world that
   they make progress. "I know! But it's too-"

   "Got to go through it!" says Babbs. They steel for the debacle,
   Armageddon, the end of all- -and sail through it!-

   --it's a focking great road-building machine of some sort, tooling down
   the highway at Mex huarache speed, the mestizos up top look down
   bewildered at this car that just shot under them at 60 or 70 ...

   Stone and Kesey tooling up toward Sonora, nice and high on speed. Stone
   thinks he's behind tinted glass in a cab, although he is doing the
   driving. So like a taxi! They pick up a kid, an American, hitchhiking back
   to California. They can take him as far as Sonora. We're going to
   California, says Stone, and they gun off. "Californee!" says Kesey, in the
   stupidest country way possible. "Yeah," says Stone. "I'm driving this
   fella here"-Kesey-"up to California to see the sun come up. He's never
   seen the sun come up."

   "Awww," says Kesey, "yer pullin my leg. Ain't no sun come up.

   "I wouldn't put you on," says Stone. "The sun comes up and you're going to
   see it." Passing strange somehow to be riding in a taxi cab through the
   Mexican nowhere with Kesey, behind a tinted glass.

   "Awwwww," says Kesey. The kid, meanwhile, is deathly quiet.

   "I'm not lying!" says Stone. "Look up there. There it is, the sum

   "Uhhh, uhhhh, God, you was right, there it is, the sun! Why ... it
   fi-i-i-i-lls the sky! It li-i-i-i-i-ights up the valley! It shi-i-i-i-ines
   upon the ocean!"

   After a few miles the kid speaks up in a casual way, best he can, "Say,
   fellows, I think I'll get out in Tepic instead of Sonora. 1 just
   remembered, I got to see somebody there."

   So he gets out.

   Never trust a Prankster!

   And Cassady-Cassady barreling onto the Rat strand in yet another Cassady
   vehicle, revved up revved up revved up at the ; eternal Cassady speed,
   with a new typical Cassady Excalibur. He has a four-pound sledge hammer
   with the handle wrapped in Day-Glo tape, which he throws about from noon
   to doom like an Indian club, flipping it up in the air and catching it,
   flipping it up in double spins, triples, quadruples, true spins, eccentric
   spins, sprocketing his shoulders his elbows his knees his feet about in
   the jerky beat. The Prank and the Schism are apparently long forgotten. If
   there's any soul can break up this focking red tide and clear the mucus
   air sailing speedily on all channels, it is Cassady. So they smoke some
   grass and climb up on top of la casa grande and sit up there while Cassady
   circuses and sprockets with his sledge hammer off on his speedy trip just
   the barest l/30th second from Now at dusk. Cassady does his wild American
   sledge hammer ballet by the side of a pool of backwater and they can see
   Cassady's reflection in the pool and their own reflection looking down at
   Cassady, but looking up in the pool in perfect asymmetric playback,
   winking Day-Glo and dusk, invoking apparitions from the past, a moon door,
   for the world in the immense act of contemplating itself, Domnu, sativa
   and rajas all at once, fons et origo, instant Movie-Now

   Wet-handle Harry!

   And the Halusion Gulp begins to shake its wings again like leather paddle
   flaps on the wheel o' fortune carnival game, a Rat bird, but it knows the
   one hole in the sky. Kesey in la casa grande with the wind up and the sky
   cloudy, and the Gulp flapping, and the Rat plaster paneled with pages from
   out of Marvel comics, whole scenes of Dr. Strange, Sub Mariner, the
   Incredible Hulk, the Fantastic Four, the Human Torch-Superheroes, in
   short. All heads believe them to be drawn by meth freaks, because of the
   minute phosphorescent dedication of their hands. Super-heroes!
   U:bermenschen! It was passing strange that Nietzsche, that curious little
   Peter Lorre misanthrope with whiskers and a sour black Tubingen
   professorial frock coat on, should be into the essence of the thing-

   -and Kesey can hear Bob Stone telling him, "Nietzsche is up in Heaven now,
   Ken, saying 'I dig what you're doing-but don't read my books' "-

   -yet the old Valkyrie was into the thing. The world not a line of cause
   and effect heading forward forever, but finite and ever-repeating, so that
   all that ever was and ever will be is caught up in now, in endless
   Recurrence, only waiting for the Superheroes to resurface; after which, a
   total revaluation. And combining Nietzsche's inspiration with his own of
   at-present-best-of man forever watching his own movie and never being able
   to get to the paradise beyond the screen: as Nietzsche glimmered, life is
   a circle and so it is the going, not the getting there, that counts. Live
   in the moment. Lots of good heads said it. I tried. I devoted much time
   and much energy. To find that those good heads had been tricked-that
   simple trick\ of I was right about living in the moment but we can never
   get in the moment! Orggggggg!

   Yet, as Pranksters and many close and near believe, he knows he has
   somehow caught sight of the great flapping beast and is somewhere beyond
   this side of the screen and into the true old full bare essence of the
   thing-he is onto what is popularly thought of as enlightenment... thinking
   back:

   Nighttime and he had gone out to the water, high on grass, and sat down
   and the light from the electric signs-Coca-Cola?-in the town came across
   the bay, and every line of light came off straight, the primitive line,
   Stone Age, the line of grass

   Cut to

   nighttime, same spot, high on acid, and the lines come off not straight
   but in perfect half circles, the acid line, the line of the

   present, the perfect circle, like the spiders they injected with acid, and
   they wove perfect little round webs

   Cut to

   nighttime, same spot, high on opium, only time he ever took hard dope, and
   the lines came off starting into circles and instead finished with a
   little hook, like the little hook in the water of a Japanese print, like
   the little hook even in the lines of that strange comic strip, The Spirit,
   and this was the line of the future, completing the circle without having
   to go all the way every time, getting there by knowing the beginning of
   the trip

   Cut to

   Nighttime and an electrical storm in the Mexican heat flashes, high on
   acid, the lightning breaking out-there!-there!-and the electricity flows
   through him and out of him, a second skin, a suit of electricity, and if
   the time was ever now it is-Now!-and he hurls his hand toward the sky to
   make the lightning break out where he points-Now!-we've got to close it,
   the gap between the flash and the eye, and make it, the reentry into Now
   ... as Superheroes ... open ... until he falls to the beach and Mountain
   Girl finds him holding his throat and choking as if he is gagging on sand
   ...

   Beyond acid. They have made the trip now, closed the circle, all of them,
   and they either emerge as Superheroes, closing the door behind them and
   soaring through the hole in the sapling sky, or just lollygag in the
   loop-the-loop of the lag. Almost clear! Presque vu!-many good heads have
   seen it-Paul telling the early Christians: hooking down wine for the Holy
   Spirit-sooner or later the Blood has got to flood into you for
   good-Zoroaster telling his followers: you can't keep taking haoma water to
   see the names of Vohu Mano-you've got to become the flames, man-And Dr.
   Strange and Sub Mariner and the Incredible Hulk and the Fantastic Four and
   the Human Torch prank about on the Rat walls of la casa grande like
   stroboscopic sledgehammer Cassadys, fons et origo ::::: and it is either
   make this thing permanent inside of you or forever just climb draggled up
   into the conning tower every time for one short glimpse of the horizon

                                    chapter

                                      XXIV

                                The Mexican Bust

   HAGEN, MEANWHILE, WAS MORE AND MORE . . . HAGEN. The irresistible charmer
   ... and it seems some beautiful deb from California had insisted on
   following him to Mexico. Dear Dad. Don't worry about me. I am in Mexico
   with some beautiful people.. . Her father sensed beatnik and dope right
   away, of course, and pulled all manner of strings to find out where she
   was and get her back. At least the Pranksters figured later that was what
   explained the mysterious debacle that came next, on the road to
   Guadalajara.

   Hagen, Kesey and Ram Rod were driving up toward Guadalajara in a panel
   truck one night when they came upon a roadblock manned by Mexican
   Federales. What to do? Turn around? bust through? fake it? At the time,
   everything had been so cool with the local legals, they were feeling
   strong and confident, and so Kesey decided to stop and just do the old
   thing of draw them into the movie. God knows the Pranksters had coped with
   many cops before.

   But-of course, they couldn't speak Mexican, so they couldn't even get the
   Movie going with these Federales. The Federales grabbed all three of them
   and searched the truck immediately for grass, which they found, and that
   wrapped that up. Out in the rain and the dark in the Rat lands. The
   Mexicans don't hassle people over grass as much as the American cops, but
   they have the same kind of laws, and they are not delighted to have
   American heads guests of their country, and Kesey was "hot," as they say.
   A certified debacle, in a word.

   This Route 15 ran along the railroad tracks that come up from the
   Guatemalan border. Between the road and the tracks were the spiky dark
   clumps of a lot of high foliage, scrub and shit, thorns, razor leaves.
   Kesey smiles sadly and goes through a big well-you-got us, fellas,
   fair-and-square pantomine, that's the way it goes. The Federales take his
   turista card, which is a fake. Yup-you-win-fellas, and say, Lemme just go
   over in them bushes a second before you haul us off. Fella has to take a
   leak; all men equal, gringos and Mex and whatever, when the piss call
   comes, right-fellas? So the Federales say O.K. and Kesey goes off in the
   scrub-

   -out the corner of his eye he sees a train easing over the siding on the
   tracks, coming around the bend slow-

   -Haul ass! Rotor Rooter! Kesey plunges into the brush toward the tracks,
   thorns and razor leaves raking his legs, the light from the train shaking
   that weird sick ochre cast over the spiky brush clumps, thrashing through
   this shit, up against the side of the train jumps up on top of a coupling,
   grabs a ladder to the top of the boxcar. Rain comes in a sudden sheet,
   lightning breaks out, lighting up the whole scene and his body-Federales
   huffing and galomping through the scrub like comic-movie Mexicans popping
   buttons off their guts and screaming !hoy! !pronto! and then

   Hrhaaaaaaaaaammmnnnnnnnnnn

   The bastards are shooting at him! Mama don't 'low no grass-smokin' in
   hyar! Testy out here on edges of professed belief-

   blackness-then Cosmo let him in on it for an instant with a flash of
   lightning-more huffing harroomping

   Hrhaaaaaaaammmnnnnnnnnnn

   comic latino cops-until the train picks up speed and he lies battened down
   to the top of the car heading off to somebody's Edge City somewhere.

   Which turns out to be Guadalajara. He has no money on him, no grass, no
   nothing. He heads for the inevitable mariachi square, hunkers down in the
   dark, wet and shivering. Wonder do they tolerate gringo bums in this town?
   Daylight a Mexican comes through the park and strikes up a conversation,
   speaks English. He is a slender guy in his twenties, very handsome like a
   Valentino, almost feminine

   !Queer!

   offers to let Kesey rest up in his hotel room

   !Queer!

   so beat and shivering he takes him on it. The hotel is one step above a
   flophouse, but clean. He has a neat little room, this Mario, a snug
   harbor. "Go ahead, get some sleep." Kesey tries to fight off the sleep
   fantasy

   !Queer assault!

   but he falls asleep anyway, wakes up a long time later, all intact. Mario
   is broke himself, but gets off a collect telegram to Manzanillo under
   Kesey's new alias, Sol Almande. Salamander, you understand-the beast that
   lives in fire. Wait around all day and the next, Mario being nothing but a
   totally sweet person.

   What's his game?

   Down to the holy telegrafo to pray. All the huarache telegrafo workers
   sitting around under fluttering leaves of telegrams piling up. Hay tiempo.
   You have to know how to approach them, says Mario. Goes upstairs in the
   telegrafo. Presently the Huarache Chief rummages through the whole heap
   for a message for the burning Almande. But-nothing.

   Next morning Kesey decides to risk it, goes down to the American consulate
   as a poor broke grizzled balding American fisherman stranded and got to
   get back to Manzanillo. A girl there, a Miss Hitchcock, gives him 27 pesos
   for third-class bus fare to Manzanillo, and he gets on, with Mario waving
   a sweet valedictory goodbye. That was your bummer, Kesey, not to
   understand that the pure humble Mexican strain of sweetness-that was all
   that Mario was about, just a muy simpatico human being. The bus ride was
   horrible, eighteen hours of bouncing through the Rat lands, half road and
   half no road, the Rat lands and yet so many open faces. They look at you
   just like a head, totally open, wanting to find something rather than hide
   something. Many piss stops, and Kesey can only struggle around grizzled,
   waiting for the driver to get on with it. Kesey is hungry and burnt out
   like a husk. About ten hours out, they're stopped and the driver walks
   back and stares at Kesey with the wide-open simpatico look and gives him
   six pesos, just like that, without a word, worth about 17 cents but good
   for a taco or suchlike, and walks on back to the front of the bus. A
   strange land, this Rat land! Sometimes they know. There is hope!-not just
   for the Superaware elected few, but for the unsuspected multitudes who
   open up and look. They are waiting, here in this Rat land.

   Back in Manzanillo, and the adrenaline was flowing again. Hagen and Ram
   Rod were salted away in jail. Like everything in Mexico, the jail scene
   was tough and soft at the same time. It was filthy, crawling with ticks,
   lice, scorpions, the whole scene. The food was filthy, too. But you could
   have anything you wanted to put down your gullet sent in, if you could pay
   for it, from luscious enchilada meals to grass, speed and acid. Hagen and
   Ram Rod stayed delightfully high and miserable.

   In any case, Kesey began to feel like it was only a matter of time before
   they closed in. It wasn't so much the Mexicans he was worried about. The
   Mexicans were always ready to make a deal. It was the Stateside zealots.
   The FBI bodysnatchers worried him. He knew about Morton Sobell, the atom
   spy, who suddenly turned up one day at a border town in the custody of an
   FBI agent, walking across the border with the Feds. If the FBI can grab
   you in Mexico, physically, the Mexicans will play along with that, too.
   And the zealous head-buff San Mateo County cops. Word was that San Mateo
   cops were taking their vacations in Mexico for no other reason than to go
   Kesey-hunting and make more fat headlines. La casa grande and the Rat
   Shack becoming steadily more uncool as first one head and then another
   showed up, with big comradely grins on, kids from California, even from
   New York, who had somehow learned where Kesey is. They always came on like
   naturally the Pranksters would be shining with joy to see them-we holy
   few, we initiates of the acid scene-with the grins spilling out over the
   edge of their lower teeth. Obviously it was a big thing on the acid scene
   in the States to know where Kesey is. That was being very inside the
   thing. Yeah-I saw Kesey down there. Then-various Pranksters brought
   friends over. Including girls, of course. And Page struck up with a tall
   blond girl, kind of a Danish maiden sort, whom they all called Doris
   Delay. It was getting like La Honda, the tropical annex, La Honda in the
   Tropic of Cancer. People were bunked in and straggled all over the place,
   in the house, in the Rat Shack, on the bus. A girl named Jeannie got bit
   by a scorpion one night. Everybody woke up and what to do. They pondered
   awhile and decided to go with the flow and they all went back to sleep.
   She survived.

   Kesey remained very permissive about the whole thing. Nobody got shunted
   off. Put my professed beliefs to the Test. In any case, it was no longer
   possible to believe there was any semblance of secrecy about the whole
   Fugitive movie now. It was just a matter of time or
   lackadaisicalityityityityityityity . . . The whole scene would get Kesey
   up tight and he would get in a car and drive up on a bluff overlooking the
   ocean and smoke grass and watch the ocean ... like Black Maria, come to
   think of it.

   Black Maria was going through a private hell. Namely, she was lonely as
   hell. Lonely? One means, how could a truly out-front person feel lonely
   amid so many truly out-front people doing so many things together and
   getting high together all the time. Would Mountain Girl ever feel lonely?
   Would Mountain Girl ever feel desperate? It was unthinkable; Mountain Girl
   was synched into this whole thing. She, Black Maria, was probably the only
   person in the history of this whole thing to get lonely ... in the
   Prankster hierarchy.

   Prankster hierarchy? There wasn't supposed to be any Prankster hierarchy.
   Even Kesey was supposed to be the non-navigator and non-teacher. Certainly
   everybody else was an equal in the brotherhood, for there was no
   competition, there were no games. They had left all that behind in the
   straight world .. . but. .. call it a game or what you will. Right now,
   among the women, Mountain Girl was first, closest to Kesey, and Faye was
   second, or was it really vice versa, and Black Maria was maybe third, but
   actually so remote it didn't matter. Among the men, there was Babbs,
   always the favorite ... and no games... but sometimes it seemed like the
   old personality game ... looks, and all the old aggressive, outgoing
   charm, even athletic ability-it won out here, like everywhere else .. .

   Yet by and by Black Maria was a Prankster. It was just there, in the air,
   the fact that she was now a Prankster. She had altered the flow, and not
   by accepting it, either.

   Page's girl, Doris Delay, was going through the same thing. There was
   something she wanted to ask somebody, but how could she ask it. Finally
   she came up to Sandy Lehmann-Haupt and said, 'What do they mean-Never
   trust a Prankster?"

                            Secret Agent Number One

   AFTERNOON - PAGE COMES BUSTING IN LA CASA GRANDE saying, "Hey! There's a
   guy across the road taking pictures of us!"

   Sure enough. There is a guy peeking over the edge of a window in an
   unfinished cottage across the beach road, another cinderblock Rat wonder.
   The sun highlights off his camera lens. Kesey gets the adrenaline pumping
   for a run, but Page charges across the road to the cottage like he owns
   the place, followed shortly by Babbs.

   Inside the cottage he finds a Mexican, dressed like a businessman,
   metallic suit, white shirt and tie, looks like he's in his thirties.

   "What the hell do you think you're doing?" says Page.

   "Hello, amigo!" the guy says, looking fairly cool. He speaks English. "I
   theenk maybe I buy thees house. You like the beach here?"

   "Yeah! Yeah! Right! Right! Right!" says Babbs. Babbs has his friendly
   put-on grin turned up to such maximum intensity the guy flinches his cool
   momentarily, but he gets it back. ' "Yes?"

   "Yeah! Yeah! Right! Right! Right!"

   "Yes. I am glad. I like another person's opeenion in thees theengs.
   Well-so long, amigos!"-and he steps outside like he's going.

   "Send us some pictures if they turn out good," says Babbs.

   "Some pictures?"

   "Yeah! Yeah! Right! Right! Right!"

   "What pictures?"

   "Of us. We like pictures. We have a whole scrapbook. We like candid
   pictures, you know? I bet you took some good ones."

   "Yes." The Mexican looks very thoughtful. "I tell you, fren, maybe you can
   help me."

   "Yeah! Yeah! Right! Right! Right!"

   "I am weeth the Mexican Naval Intelligence, and maybe you can help ... us.
   We have reports of Russian submarines operating in these waters."

   "Sub-ma-rines!" says Babbs in total put-on wonderment.

   Several Pranksters have gathered in front of la casa grande to watch Babbs
   and Page and the Mexican outside the Rat cottage.

   "Yes," says the Mexican. "We have reports that thees submarines are coming
   een to shore at night, in thees waters. Have you notice eeny such
   acteevity?"

   "No-tice!" says Babbs. "Well I reckon by Christ we have! You oughta come
   out here some night! Some nights there's so goddamn many of them, you
   can't go to sleep for the signal lights. Shine right in the windows,
   blinking something fierce, and it's a tough code. A tough code. But we'll
   break it yet. We got a lotta good heads working on it. Why, this fella
   right here"-pointing to Page, and rattling on about the incredible brazen
   activity of the Russian submarines in these waters-while Cassady comes
   across the road, flipping his sledge hammer, singles, doubles, triples,
   way up in the air looping it, catching it behind his back,

   and so on, but not looking at them for a second. Cassady sets a brick up
   on a fence about fifteen feet from the Mexican, but doesn't say a word or
   even look, ratcheting his arms and legs this way and that to his private
   Joe Cuba. Then he heads back across the road.

   "Yes," says the Mexican. "Please may I ask you thees. We have a report on
   one of thees Russian who maybe was landing here from a submarine. He ees
   about five feet eleven, he ees a ... muscular man ... he looks about
   thirty years old ... he has ... blond hair, hees hair ees curly and he ees
   a leetle bald on the top... Have you seen eeny such person?"

   "One of these Russians!" says Babbs. "Have you been to Eat Alley?"

   "Eat Alley?"

   "Yeah! Yeah! Right! Right! Right! The marketplace ace. All you hear in the
   marketplace is Russian. They're all over the place. This thing is wide
   open already, man ! "

   The guy cocks his head and stares at Babbs through his shades as if maybe
   this will bring him into focus-

   -just then-

   Feeoofeeoofeeoofeeoofeeoofeeoofeeoofeeoo

   !Whop!

   -Cassady-twenty feet away across the beach road has suddenly wheeled and
   fired the four-pound sledge hammer end-over-end like a bolo and smashed
   the brick on top of the fence into obliteration, fifteen feet from the
   Mexican.

   "Yes," says the Mexican. "Thank you, fren." And he wheels and walks off at
   a good clip, down the road, and gets into a sedan and hauls out of there.

   THE NEXT DAY, HOWEVER, THE LITTLE DUDE IS BACK, WALKING along the beach
   road with a bounce, so Babbs goes out to meet him.

   "Amigo!" the guy says. "Have you seen any Russians today!"-this with a big
   sparkling grin, as if to say it's all been a grand joke among us fellows
   who are in on it.

   So Babbs thinks it over and says, Let's go up to the Polynesian palace and
   have a talk about the whole thing. Man to man.

   So the Mexican says O.K. and they head up toward town toward a Polynesian
   restaurant up the way. Well, that gets the guy away from la casa grande,
   at least. Kesey has been primed for this, ready to make a run for it in
   one of the cars. He could head for the jungle, but the jungle is such a
   total bummer. On the other hand the road out is no bargain, either. If
   they are really closing in, they could have Route 15 bottled up so fast
   he'd never make it. Well, get out of la casa grande, in any case. So he
   and Stone get into Stone's car and drive up to the bluff overlooking the
   ocean and have a couple of tokes to assess the situation.

   They park up on the bluff and look down at the festering red tide. The
   focking festering red tide. They turn the situation this way and that, and
   then Kesey decides: it is no use running either into the jungle or up the
   road. That's their game, the cops-and-robbers game. That's their movie,
   and they know their movie backward and forward, and they know how that one
   comes out, and we know how it comes out. Justice triumphs after a merry
   chase and the Fugitive eats dung dust in the last reel to show the horror
   of his dope-fiend ways. The only way out is to make it the Prankster movie
   and imagine this metallic little dude into the Prankster movie. There's no
   one to run to to say, Mommy, this movie is no fun any more, it's too real,
   Mommy. Up tight against the professed beliefs, Major, and you better
   believe! or else draggle your ass inaudible ... They get to talk about
   Fugitive movies they have seen in which the Fugitive wins out, and they
   hit upon Casablanca, the Humphrey Bogart picture. Bogart was a fugitive in
   Casablanca, in the Moroccan desert, operating a restaurant during World
   War II, aiding and abetting Resistance fighters from Europe, and the
   Nazi-type or Vichy France-type FBI man, the cop heavy, in any case, comes
   in to question him.

   "Why did you come to Casablanca?" he says.

   "For the waters," says Bogart.

   "There is no water here," says the cop heavy. "We are in the middle of the
   desert."

   "Oh?" says Bogart. "I was misinformed."

   There it is! The Movie! So Stone and Kesey drive back and join Babbs and
   the Mexican dude in the Polynesian bar.

   The Mexican dude and Babbs have been having quite a time. Six or eight
   beer bottles are on the table, and the Mexican dude is waxing very high
   and expansive, gesturing grandly, urging them to sit down and carrying on.
   He wants to know Kesey's name and Kesey says Sol Almande. Babbs has given
   him a shuck name of his own, and Stone says he is from Esquire magazine.
   He studies an expense voucher from Esquire that Stone has as if it is a
   highly suspicious document. Then he whips out his billfold from inside his
   coat and flips it open, displaying a big badge with the number 1 on it.

   "What's that?" says Babbs.

   "That! I am Agent numero uno!"

   "Se-cret A-gent Num-ber One!" says Babbs.

   "Yeah! Yeah! Right! Right! Right!" says Agent Number One, drawing his head
   back and taking an angle on Babbs. It is like a cross between Zorro and
   Nero.

   Then he goes into a history of his famous cases.

   "Eleezabeth Taylor ees coming to Mexico City? Si. That ees my case. I know
   her very well. Si. I am going around to her hotel, and she has all thees
   people-Uhhh"-he turns his hands up and pulls his chin down under his
   collarbone as if to say it is doubtful they could even comprehend how many
   people she has-"all thees functionaries doing thees and doing that, een
   the corridor outside even, and one of theem, thees beeg maricon"-meaning
   queer-"he tells me, 'No one can go een! No one.' "

   " No one, ay,' I tell heem. He ees a beeg maricon. I can tell. There ees a
   look they have, thees maricons. They have cojinas the size of habichuelas,
   one can see it een the face, een the voice ... they are soft like sheet,
   thees maricons...

   " 'Maricon!' I say to heem.

   "Hees voice, eet jes 'oops!'-you know?-like a leetle theeng of water.

   " 'Out of my way, maricon!' "-Agent Number One half leaps out of his chair
   with the reenactment, his eyes bouncing off his shades, shooting up like
   he is galvanized with a thousand volts.

   Then he sinks back.

   "We-e-e-ellll," he says very softly, and smiles like someone getting ready
   to drop off to sleep. The way he says it, you can see the maricon
   collapsing, dissolving, turning into little driblets of jelly and opening
   the door to Miss Taylor's suite.

   There is no stopping Agent Number One now. Exploit after exploit bubbles
   up in his brain. Cornered like a rat, he faces them down. About to be cut
   down in fusillades, he whips his revolver and fires one shot, one shot,
   amigo, and that takes care of that. The sonsabeetches theenk they have him
   outsmarted, ready to make their move, and he has already made his move and
   is waiting for them, like a bucket under a faucet, and so on.

   The strange thing, however, is that none of these fabulous cases has
   anything to do with celebrities. They're all marijuana cases, usually
   involving Americans. Yes.

   Finally he takes out his camera and takes a picture of each of them.

   Kesey says, "Why don't you come to our party tomorrow night? A lot of
   people will be there."

   "Your party?"

   "Yeah, we're having a farewell party tomorrow night."

   "Farewell?"

   "Yeah. We're leaving Mexico and going back up to California, so we're
   giving a farewell party."

   "Well, thank you, amigo. I weel be there."

   So began the first Mexican Acid Test

   .

   agent number one wasn't the most brilliant cop in the Americas, but time
   was obviously running out in old Mexico. It was time to get the Movie
   going on all projectors. And the bus. The new fantasy was to get on the
   bus and keep moving; roam through Mexico and give Acid Tests and be on the
   bus, keeping the Pranksters movie going at top speed at all times.

   They held the Manzanillo Test in the courtyard of Babbs's Rat Shack, under
   the aegis of the Purina Chow. It was a small one, with all random heads in
   the area welcome. No Grateful Dead, of course, so they gave the Polynesian
   restaurant latino combo ten bucks to come down the road and play during
   their intermissions. Between times the Pranksters themselves furnished the
   music, rolling all the fantastic coils of wire out, with Gretch on the
   organ, and the movies and lights and all the rest. The night was full of
   heat lightning, which was nice, and the Prankster musicians screeled their
   weird Chinese tones, wailing electronically in the Rat netherlands. But no
   Secret Agent Numero Uno.

   Kesey actually hoped the guy would turn up. He was just crazy enough to be
   adaptable for the Movie. He was a creature of fantasy himself. In any
   case, better him there gathering more data for his fabulous career than
   lurking in the cocoa palms working himself up to spring his ultimate cop
   fantasy on them. Well, if so, they would go out freaking and wailing on
   the shores of the red tide.

   The Polynesian players came down the road again and played. It was nice to
   get freaked to latino syncopation. Then a lull, and then the shit-

   !Hoy! !Pronto!

   -this piping shout from the other side of the Rat Shack. And where have I
   heard that cry before, Cosmo?

   !Hoy! !Pronto!

   And all veer stroked out waiting for the pounce. More pounce to the ounce
   in a Mexican bust. Well, let's have it-let's see the Federales do their
   fantasy to mariachis, breaking on the high notes and struggling up again
   and huffing and galomphing with gold butts and stars in their teeth

   !Hoy! !Pronto!

   Come on in, fellas, it's strictly Dutch freak here inside-

   -and around the corner comes only the owner of the Polynesian palace,
   pissed off because his combo is hung up on the crazies here long past
   intermission and he has enough problems in the red-tide doldrums without
   them malingering with the crazies.

   "!Hoy! !Pronto!" he keeps shouting. !Hurry up! Get your asses back to the
   store! prodding and herding them out of the Purina Chow palace delirium.

   !Hoy! !Pronto!

   The heat freak lightning flashes crazy enough and it is a good sign. The
   Movie is going.

   THE PRANKSTERS PULLED OUT OF MANZANILLO THE NEXT DAY without a word or a
   move from Agent Number One, big as life on the bus, plus a small caravan
   of cars. They headed to Guadalajara and gave an Acid Test in a restaurant
   there. The Test went on two nights and each night a well-dressed Mexicano
   with the gleaming nighttime Mexico white shirt over his staunch midriff
   turned up with a go-go girl and stayed right through, although they didn't
   take acid. Smiled and danced and seemed to enjoy themselves. Turned out he
   was the local jefe of detectives. We are not alone.

   The bus tooled into Aguascalientes, 364 miles northwest of Mexico City,
   loaded for Acid Tests. Aguascalientes is 6,000 feet up in tierras frescas
   with a paradise climate in late summer, a nicely weird city, built above a
   vast system of tunnels by ... an unknown race ... Pranksters in the time
   warp of many millennia ago. Suddenly Sandy was immensely enthusiastic.
   Sandy had packed his motorcycle onto the bus. He was getting more and more
   robust day by day, all for this Mexican adventure.

   The mineral springs! said Sandy. You got to try them! A warm soothing
   mineral spring bath soaking late-summer paradise into every
   bone-Cleanliness is Next. Aguascalientes was what all these tierras del
   fuego were piled up rock by rock for, this little bit of Heaven in the
   upper altitudes.

   Mountain Girl listened to all this and she knew, well, that would be that.
   They would hang around Aguascalientes the rest of the day. If there was
   one thing Kesey couldn't resist, it was the prospect of a long warm soak.
   He would stay in a warm tub one hour any time, and the paradisiacal
   Aguascalientes were good for four or five hours, easy.

   So Kesey and many Pranksters went off and immersed up to their chops in
   the warm springs. Hagen was delegated to stay behind and watch the bus and
   all the Acid Test equipment inside. Sandy went off to take a spin on his
   motorcycle.

   Presently Sandy turned back up at the bus. He looked most big and bright.
   He had on an orange jacket gleaming Day-Glo and much orange Day-Glo on his
   bike and was looking strong. Sandy climbed up in the bus and went back in
   there and presently he emerged carrying the big Ampex.

   "What are you doing with that?" says Hagen.

   "I need something heavy to put on the back of my bike for a test run,"
   says Sandy. "I'm going to be carrying a lot of stuff back to New York and
   I want to find out how much I can maneuver with on this thing."

   "Well-I don't know," says Hagen. Man, there's something wrong with this.
   "Prankster equipment isn't supposed to leave the bus. You know what the
   Chief says."

   "It's not leaving the bus," says Sandy. "I just want to take it down a few
   blocks to see how the bike handles with a weight on it."

   All the time Sandy is tying the huge clump of equipment down on the back
   rider's seat of the bike. It's so heavy and bulky it doesn't look like he
   could make ten miles with it.

   "I don't think you should," says Hagen.

   "I'll be right back," says Sandy-and he guns off, with the bike drooping
   in the back.

   An hour goes by, two hours, and he isn't back. Hagen is worried. Then
   Kesey shows up, back from the baths. Let's go! says Kesey. He sees the
   whole thing right away. The fateful Ampex that Sandy had hassled over a
   year ago. The sombitch has split.

   They jump in a car and take off up the highway north, toward Zacatecas. He
   has a big start but he won't be getting very far with that back end loaded
   down like it is. They go barreling through the Coca-Cola and Carta Blanca
   crossroads of old Mexico, up past Chicalote and Rincon de Romos and San
   Francisco, everywhere stopping and shouting at the Mex drugstore cowboys
   on the corner.

   "Hey! Have you seen a crazy gringo on a motorcycle-all dressed in orange?"

   "No." "No." "No."-the bastards, they're too battened down in their
   huaraches to say so anyway-and they barrel on up through the dung dust but
   finally give up and trail on back to the bus.

   "Shit," says Mountain Girl, "that Ampex is the guts of the Acid Test."

   The whole complicated thing of the instruments, the variable lag, the
   synchronicity, the taping for the Archives-they can't do it without the
   Ampex. Sandy has taken the Prankster Ampex-to the Pranksters there was not
   the slightest doubt in the world that the equipment was the Pranksters'.
   Not Prankster Sandy Lehmann-Haupt's but the Pranksters'. The Prankster
   family, the Prankster order, superseded all straight-world ties, contracts
   and chattel laws and who is my mother or my brethren? And he looked round
   about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my
   brethren! For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother,
   and my sister, and my mother.

   And there was nothing left but the vision of the sombitch tooling up the
   Mexican National Highway, struggling on his Suzuki to haul.. . possessions
   back to New York. New York. So this was what he had built up the strength
   for. Six thousand freaking miles on a 250-pound motorcycle to seek out his
   electronic chattel and draggle it back, freaking Day-Glo in the sundown
   toward the border.

   ABOUT 4,500 FEET AWAY, SANDY RESTED IN THE SHADOW Behind a big corrugated
   tin shed. Out in the open sun there-the runway of the Aguascalientes
   airport with brown Mexicans in coveralls lollygagging around. Sandy had
   been a man of his word, up to a given point, so to speak. He had gone a
   couple of blocks, like he said. Then he took a right and rode on over to
   the city airport and parked behind the shed ... and waited ... and was
   Kesey really so far into Now, such a master precognition, that he would
   shoot the Zen arrow ... or let him draw it, rather, and come straight
   there and hassle him upside the bus again and in that moment let him know
   irrevocably who has the Power, the control over his mind forever ...

   Strangely, the paranoia lasted only for a twinge as he caught his breath
   in the shade. In fact, he was strangely calm, as if the chase were now
   over, rather than begun. He had done it. It had been his movie. He had
   drawn them into his scenario. Mike Hagen. "We-e-e-e-11," he had said. "I
   don't kno-o-o-ow. You know what the Chief says." He knew. He had been on
   the bus for three years. The trip had been liberation and captivity all at
   the same time, liberation, power, will, the greatest in the world-and
   whose will? The group mind's? Well, he had never had a dream war with the
   group mind, he had never been held in thrall by the group mind, he had
   never been subject to absolute judgment by the group mind, waiting for the
   one cryptic word that will say, It's O.K., Sandy.

   Naturally he could never haul the big Ampex 3,000 miles on a motorcycle.
   It would be a little pile of gleaming whimsy, like one of Paul Foster's
   acid-bag transistor radios, by the time he reached the border, from the
   interminable bouncing. But he had that figured out. There was a Railway
   Express Agency in Aguas-calientes. He would take the Ampex over there and
   ship it to New York collect and ride back on the motorcycle free as a
   bird. Which he did.

   A YEAR LATER I TALKED TO SANDY IN CENTRAL PARK, DOWN BY the edge of the
   lake near Central Park South. He looked good, strong, calm. He was going
   with a good-looking blonde whom I had met. He had a job as a sound
   engineer with one of the recording companies. We got to talking for a long
   time about his adventures with the Pranksters, and dusk came on, and we
   related what we had each heard of Kesey recently, and it started getting
   dark, so we got up and left the park. And in all of it Sandy spoke with
   warmth, about Kesey, about the whole experience, with no traces of rancor.
   It started getting dark and we got up and walked out of the park. Just
   before we parted, Sandy turned to me and said, "You know ... I'll always
   be on the bus."

   "LEO! LEO! YOU ARE LEO, AREN'T YOU? DO YOU NOT KNOW ME any more? We were
   League brothers together and should still be so. We were both travelers on
   the journey to the East."

   THE PRANKSTERS MOVED ON TO MEXICO CITY AND ENVIRONS, giving a couple of
   Acid Tests, but without any astounding gusto. American heads from the
   Ajijic-San Miguel de Allende-Mexico City Circuit gathered proudly-Yeah-I
   ran into Kesey and the Pranksters in Mexico and we all got stoned. A few
   Indians came and got taciturnly freaked.

   Meanwhile, Kesey's lawyers were hassling with Mexico City immigration
   legals in Mexico City to see about getting him a proper visa for a long
   haul, and they blew hot and cool. And then cooler and cooler. They seemed
   to be followed, the Pranksters and the bus, by carloads of well-dressed
   Mexican dudes here and there. Stone saw more than anyone else but kept
   driving. Cassady hauling the bus over the Mexico tierras frias with his
   new goal up against now of going the length and breadth of Mexico without
   using the brakes and without stopping for anything, hauling off onto
   crumbling scrubroot shoulders rather than stop for carts or cars or
   animals, smoothing out his stroke, from the Joe Cuba spastokinetic jerk,
   the sudden straight lines, into a new line-the new line-Kesey can see it
   happening even in the eternal Cassady-but of course!-in him first of
   all-from Fire to Water, from the Stone Age into the Acid Age and in a
   moment-now- Furthur-

   HAUL ASS, KESEY! IT WAS NOW TIME TO BRING THE FUTURE back to the U.S.A.,
   back to San Francisco, and brazen it out with the cops and whatever else
   there. The Mexican legals were hinting at booting him out, maybe in a
   month, on the technicality of no visa. But the Rat lands were spent
   anyway. They had junked it through on the fabulous junk of Mexico. They
   had gorged it up. They had ... in truth, Major, there were no more spas to
   water at in the Rat lands.

   The current fantasy was to take the Outlaw prank to its ultimate, be a
   Prankster Fugitive Extraordinaire in the Baskin-Robbins bosom of the
   U.S.A. You have never seen a Prankster Fugitive? Now watch that movie;
   draws you right in ...

   Kesey had a good melodrama for going back in. Paint it big enough and
   bright enough, and they will never see you. He figured to sneak back in on
   the purloined-letter principle. If you are gross enough about the whole
   thing, they will never know it's you.

   Kesey picked Brownsville, Texas, for the reentry. It was the easternmost
   entry point on the Mexican border, practically on the Gulf of Mexico, and
   the least likely spot for heads to pick to go back in at. Most of the
   heads used the western end, the Tijuana end, because they were going back
   to California.

   So he put on a cowboy hat and just before the U.S. Customs and Immigration
   Station at Brownsville raunched into view, he rented a Mexican's swayback
   white horse and got on with his cowboy hat cocked on crazily, playing a
   guitar and lolling his head around like he was drunk. He came cross the
   border lurching along on an old white horse as "Singing Jimmy Anglund."

   "How long you been in Mexico?"

   "Too damn long."

   "May I see your visa?"

   "I don't have it."

   "Where is it?"

   Visa-how the hell did he know. Came down to play a country & western show
   in that fuckin Matamoros, and be damned if they didn't get him drunk, them
   fuckin Mexes, their fuckin women and their margaritas, and they rolled his
   ass in the streets of Matamoros, took his money and his papers, cleaned
   him out, and he got drunker and he stayed drunker in this godderned
   Mexico, bricked up his bowels with terra cotta, and him just a good old
   boy from Boise, Idaho, and that's where he's going back, no more Mexico,
   no more Las Vegas-

   "Have you got any identification?"

   "All I got's this here-"

   -and he shows the browntrooper a credit card, Bank of America, reading
   James C. Anglund, Las Vegas, Nevada.

   So they let him across and he headed down the road clawing

   on the guitar and lolling around on the back of the horse, although they
   retrieved the horse from him-can't let any disease sneak across the border
   from the Rat lands, you understand-

   Singing Jimmy Anglund started thumbing out in the dust with his Rat-tar
   under the other arm ...

   Yah! the cops and robbers game.

   Kesey holes up at his old friend---'s house in Palo Alto. He is in a
   strange state of mind. He is in the cops' movie now, the Cops and Robbers
   Game, and eventually they will win, because it is their movie-Gotcha!
   Unless he makes it his movie, which will take the utmost risk and daring.
   Here I am, boys... In the cops and robbers game you creep and skulk about
   in a state of tachycardia, and they like to think of you in your reptile
   misery-so-

   Break skulk!

   In short, the fantasy is now to become a kind of Day-Glo Pimpernel,
   popping up here and there, right out in public, then vanishing, reeking
   legend in the wake. He will be like one of those movie criminals who send
   florid coded notes to the police about au pair girls he intends to
   garrote-and then does it-while all the world pants for next week's broken
   hyoid bone. Only he hasn't been strangling, merely smoking grass. You
   would never know that, however, from the excitement in San Francisco ...

   A strange sort of guest to have in the house- and----------hardly knows
   what to make of the performance, Kesey veering wildly from paranoia and
   hyper-security to extraordinary disregard for his own safety, one state
   giving way to the other in no fixed order. Kesey gets up about noon or 1
   p.m., eats, then goes out in the garden out back and sits there in his
   buckskin shirt playing a Prankster flute. If one plays anything much more
   bizarre than a transistor radio out back in the garden in Palo Alto, it
   amounts to freaking insurrection; let alone a big muscular Mountain Man in
   a buckskin shirt playing a flute. Then at night-a few tokes here, a few
   tokes there, it adds up, Major, Kesey and a Prankster or two start to
   rapping, gently

   Rapping

   Cortex tapping

   Rat-tat-tatting

   Tatter-ratting

   Fooling, puling, ululation

   Skeel goose screeling glossolalia

   Crested screamers! Megascops!

   Bust the eardrums! Freak the cops!

   until 2 a.m. the house would be reeling with enough Rat-tars, loon cries,
   tapes and howling grass euphoria to wake up all of sweet dream tunnel Palo
   Alto for the next fifteen years-but then suddenly at 4 a.m., or 5, after
   outlasting everyone in the mad howl, Kesey would suddenly decide it was
   time for maximum security precautions and would disappear into the cellar
   to a snug nest behind the packing cases, in the cobwebs. Well, at least
   the bastards won't get him with Gestapo tap on the shoulder-All right,
   Kesey ...

   That movie-but then awakening and starting his movie almost at once. Neal,
   Hugh Romney, Kesey and a small detachment of Hell's Angels head for a
   three-day "trips festival" in progress at San Francisco State College,
   Saturday night, October 1. The seeds one has sown... The Acid Tests have
   already caught hold in the college world. San Francisco State has become
   the acid heads' true universitas, sort of the way Ohio State is for
   football freaks. They are trying the whole thing, the Acid Test, with the
   utmost faithful eclecticism.

   Beta,

   Collegiate!

   Donkey beads,

   Psychedelic!

   The Hell's Angels are riding shotgun for the Fugitive. They like this.
   They can freak out any approaching cops, in cruiser or battalion. For some
   suitable weird reason all the lights are left on in the campus buildings.
   The festival is in the gymnasium-full of scaffolding and people sweeping
   the ceilings with movies and light projections-Control towers-and the
   Grateful Dead on the bandstand, all careful homage to the original Acid
   Tests, and then suddenly

   Kesey

   will be there, broadcasting into the gymnasium from a campus radio station
   ... a very tight ship, this fantasy, even up to Hell's Angels standing
   guard outside the studio. Except that by the time they get all the wiring
   hooked up, and start rapping, Cassady with a microphone inside the
   hall-introducing

   Ken Keeeee-Zeeeeee

   it is about 4 a.m. Kesey is hidden in the studio, talking over the hugest
   Prankster hookup of wires, running long over the college campus to the
   gymnasium. Freewheeling Frank, the Hell's Angel, zonked on acid, barges
   into the studio, and sees Kesey there sitting on a stool with an electric
   guitar and wires running all around his legs and his neck, branging on the
   guitar, rapping poetry into the microphone with fluorescent light and on
   the air sign filling up the room-The god of LSD-He's so wired up it scares
   me-This god reminds me of a satellite that flies around in the
   skies-whereupon Frank hugs him and feels an immediate surge of electricity
   and sits down on the floor and starts playing a harmonica and Kesey raps
   on for the benefit of the hundreds watching the swirling light shows in
   the gymnasium: "You who stand sit and crawl around and about the floor
   about you and above you on the ceiling that madness that's running in
   color is your brain!"-and then he stalks out of the room-

   He's mad because he has not captured my mind-thinks Frank-he has so many
   million minds that he has captured that not even a smile is left on his
   face.

   But there were no millions or even hundreds left in the gymnasium because
   it was so late it was down to a group of hard-core heads, many of whom
   were so high they were used to all sorts of time and geography warps.
   Everything was real, Mani, Madame Blavatsky's Chohan maya, Ken Kesey
   broadcasting over the p.a. system ... Kesey finally comes out and walks
   through the residue, but they are all wacked out and he is hardly visible
   ... in his Prankster suit of flaming Orion paranoia . . .

   Nevertheless! the word is now out among the heads of Haight-Ashbury. Kesey
   is back, the Man, the Castro who won them what they have today in the
   first place. The seeds we ...

   . . . HAVE SOWN . . . DOWN IN RAT LAND RED TIDE MANZANILLO, Kesey and the
   Pranksters had been so cut off they got almost no news from San Francisco.
   It was all perfect Devil's Island down there. They had only a dim idea of
   what was going on among the heads in Haight-Ashbury. But now, like, you
   don't even have to look for it. It hits you in the face. It's a whole
   carnival... All you have to do is walk up into the Haight-Ashbury-and
   Kesey chances a run through ... Hell, in Haight-Ashbury a muscular guy in
   cowboy boots and a cowboy hat-he ... looks healthy. The cops are busy
   trying to figure out these new longhairs, these beatniks-these crazies are
   somehow weirder than the North Beach beatniks ever were. They glow blue
   like a TV tube. The hippie-dippies.. . their Jesus hair, men with hair
   falling down to the shoulders and beards to their chests, all lank and
   thin and limp like... lungers! Sergeant, they're lollygagging up against
   the storefronts on Haight Street up near that Psychedelic Shop like
   somebody hocked a bunch of T.B. lungers up against windows and they've
   oozed down to the sidewalks, staring at you with these huge zombie eyes,
   just staring. And a lot of weird American Indian and Indian from India
   shit, beaded headbands and donkey beads and temple bells-and the live
   ones, promenading up and down Haight Street in costumes, or half-costumes,
   like some kind of a doorman's coat with piping and crap but with blue
   jeans for pants and Mod boots.. . The cops!-oh, how it messed up their
   minds.

   The cops knew drunks and junkies by heart, and they knew about LSD, but
   this thing that was going on . . . The heads could con the cops blind and
   it was wild. Haight-Ashbury had always been a brave little tenement
   district up the hill from the Panhandle entrance to Golden Gate Park, with
   whites and Negroes living next door in peace. Rents had been going up in
   North Beach. A lot of young couples with bohemian enthusiasms had been
   moving to Haight-Ashbury. Some of the old beats had moved in. They hung
   around a place called the Blue Unicorn. But the Trips Festival of eight
   months before was what really kicked the whole thing off. Eight
   months!-and all of a sudden it was like the Acid Tests had taken root and
   sprung up into people living the Tests like a whole life style.

   The Grateful Dead had moved into a house in Haight-Ashbury, and it wasn't
   just the old communal living where everybody piled into some place. They
   lived in Prankster-style, as a group with a name and a mission, which was
   music and the psychedelic vision ... Yes... A thin, almost caved-in guy
   with incredible freaking light-brown Jesus hair and beard flowing all over
   him and round wire-rim spectacles, named Chet Helms, had a group called
   the Family Dog. They also lived in Prankster-style, in a garage at 1090
   Page, holding rock 'n' roll dances amid a lot of Indian symbols. They had
   taken part in the Trips Festival. Helms was a head but a very practical
   head. He saw it coming, with the Trips Festival, the whole wave. He
   started an ongoing Trips Festival, every week, selling tickets, at a
   ballroom, the Avalon, at Van Ness and Sutter. Bill Graham, the impresario
   for the Trips Festival, was into the thing too and had a Trips Festival
   scene going in the Fillmore Auditorium, a dancehall at Fillmore and Geary.
   Graham and Kesey had had a falling out at the Trips Festival itself over
   things like who was going to handle the gate and it ended in a badass
   moment when Graham put out his hand to shake and make up and Kesey just
   looked at it and walked away. But Graham picked up on the Acid Test format
   exactly. Both the Fillmore and the Avalon did the Pranksters Acid Test
   with all the mixed media stuff, the rock 'n' roll and movie projections
   and the weird intergalactic amoeba light shows. The Avalon even had it
   down to details like the strobes and sections of the floor where you could
   play with Day-Glo paint under black light. Everything but the . .. fourth
   dimension ... Cosmo ... the three o'clock thing ... the experience, the
   kairos... They know where it is, but they don't know what it is... Still,
   the ballrooms were like a big announcement and a front door ... into The
   Life.

   The new communal groups themselves were into the pudding. Like the
   Diggers, led by a guy named Emmett Grogan, whose hero was Kesey. They went
   in for pranks. They had a Frame of Reference, a huge frame nine feet tall
   that they set up in the street and asked people to walk through ... "so
   we'll all be in the same frame of reference." Then they started handing
   out free food to all comers, heads, winos, anybody, at 4 p.m. in the
   Panhandle part of the park. The food they cadged from wholesalers, and
   boosted, and so on. It was a goddamn sketch, seeing them ladle out the
   stew every day out of big milk cans... Up at Fulton and Scott is a great
   shambling old Gothic house, a freaking decayed giant, known as The Russian
   Embassy. A new group called the Calliope Company lives in there, led by
   Bill Tara, an actor. Many colorful characters like Paul Hawken, and
   Michael Laton, who always wears a Russian astrakhan hat, and Jack the
   Fluke, who is a laughing grizzly Irishman with a beard like an Airedale
   and a cab driver's cap and flapping tweeds bought from the Slightly Soiled
   Shop ... all of them sitting around the great parlor, bare but a glory of
   old carved wood, fourteen-foot ceilings... Jack the Fluke tells about his
   girlfriend Sandra, a teenage girl who just pulled in from Bucks County,
   Pa.:

   "I come in"-and he motions with his head up toward his room on the top
   floor-"and, dig: she has a joint rolled this big, like a cigar, man!-and
   she's goofing off the radio and puffing on this, I mean, Corona corona
   joint and goofing and puffing-it was beautiful! It really takes me back."

   But of course! the esoteric nostalgia of those first days of discovery,
   the first little easing open of the doors of the mind with marijuana and
   that thing you do at that stage!-that goofing off the radio thing-You
   know? And it's beautiful, the kids beginning to pour in to Haight-Ashbury
   ... for The Life ... It's a carnival! the Garden of Eden! one big urban La
   Honda scene! right out in the open! with all things available. Money is
   floating around in the air. That's no hassle. Hell, in three hours you can
   pick up nine or ten bucks panhandling. Christ, when the straight citizens
   see a kid in a beard and beads and flowers with a sign around his neck
   saying My Heart is Prouder than my Stomach, it fucking blows their minds,
   and they lay quarters on you, dollar bills. It's too much. And if worse
   comes to worse, there is always ...

   "Anybody want a straight job?" says a girl named Jeannie, who lives here
   at The Embassy. Michael Laton says yeah, and it turns out Jeannie is
   working three or four hours a night as a Topless Shoe Shine girl in a
   little shoeshine shack on Broadway in North Beach, and they need a barker
   outside on the sidewalk to spiel in customers. Michael Laton takes this,
   yes, straight job, and stands out there at night in a tuxedo and a tall
   hat hawking in the dentists who are crawling all over North Beach panting
   over the Topless. They come inside the shack and climb up on the shoeshine
   stand and put their feet on the shoeshine stirrups and watch Jeannie's
   tits dangle and jiggle for ninety seconds while she shines their shoes for
   two dollars and a big lugubrious spade stands by with his hand near a lead
   beer bottle to smash wiseguys and sex fiends with and they all come out
   saying the exact same thing: "And the funny part is, it's a damned good
   shoeshine!"

   "... so I dropped a little acid, like just for the flash, you know," says
   Michael Laton, "and these two Marines come up, this big sergeant and
   another one, with hashmarks on their sleeves, like up to here. I'm eight
   feet tall by this time, and they're like ants, I'm so stoned, and I yell
   right in their faces: 'If they stop the war, you guys will be out of a
   job!' And the sergeant says Yeahhh?-and man! like it reverses-now they're
   eight feet tall all of a sudden and I'm an ant! and . .."

   A very carnival! and it wasn't politics, what he said, just a prank,
   because the political thing, the whole New Left, is all of a sudden like
   over on the hip circuit around San Francisco, even at Berkeley, the very
   citadel of the Student Revolution and all. Some kid who could always be
   counted on to demonstrate for the grape workers or even do dangerous
   things like work for CORE in Mississippi turns up one day-and immediately
   everybody knows he has become a head. His hair has the long jesuschrist
   look. He is wearing the costume clothes. But most of all, he now has a
   very tolerant and therefore withering attitude toward all those who are
   still struggling in the old activist political ways for civil rights,
   against Vietnam, against poverty, for the free peoples. He sees them as
   still trapped in the old "political games," unwittingly supporting the
   oppressors by playing their kind of game and using their kind of tactics,
   while he, with the help of psychedelic chemicals, is exploring the
   infinite regions of human consciousness ... Paul Hawken here in The
   Embassy-in 1965 he was an outstanding activist, sweat shirts and blue
   jeans and toggle coats, went on the March from Selma, worked as a
   photographer for CORE in Mississippi, risked his life to take pictures of
   Negro working conditions, and so on. Now he's got on a great Hussar's coat
   with gold frogging. His hair is all over his forehead and coming around
   his neck in terrific black Mykonos curls.

   "I take it you aren't too tight with CORE any more."

   He just laughs.

   "What about all the things you were involved in last year?"

   "All that's changed. You should have seen them leaving for Sacramento"-Cal
   students leaving Berkeley for Sacramento and a demonstration.

   "Yeah," says Tara.

   "It was all fraternity men with sports shirts and crew cuts and their own
   cars and painted signs, you know, like you get from a commercial artist.
   There was a lot of bread out there."

   "Yeah," says Tara, "and they're all talking about channels. They're going
   to do this and that through existing channels, or they can't do this or
   that through existing channels, they're all talking about channels."

   "Yeah," says Paul, "and shaking their fists"-he raises his fist and shakes
   it in a big shuck way-"and saying, 'We're off to Sacramento to protest,
   with our dates!' It's all changed. It's all a bunch of fraternity men in
   their Mustangs."

   A bunch of fraternity men in their Mustangs! In the intellectual-hip world
   of California, there is no more scathing epithet imaginable. A bunch of
   fraternity men in their Mustangs. Just savor it. Oh Mario, and Dylan, and
   Joan Baez, oh Free Speech and Anti-Vietnam-who in his right mind would
   have ever dreamed it could come to this in twelve months-abandoned to the
   supermarket and the breezeway scions-a bunch of fraternity men in
   Mustangs-and it is, unbelievably, all as the provocateur Kesey has
   prophesied it, droning on his goddamned harmonica and saying Just walk
   away and say fuck it...

   Square hip! Boy Scout bohemians! and the great rallies at Berkeley that
   used to pull 10,000 are now lucky to get a thousand. All changed! Even the
   thing with the spades. All of a sudden the Negroes are out of the hip
   scene, except for a couple of pushers like Superspade and a couple of
   characters like Gaylord and Heavy. The explanation around Haight-Ashbury
   is that Negroes don't take to LSD. The big thing with spades on the hip
   scene has always been the quality known as cool. And LSD freaking well
   blows that whole lead shield known as cool, like it brings you right out
   front, hang-ups and all. Also the spades don't get much of a kick out of
   the nostalgia for the mud that all the white middle-class kids who are
   coming to Haight-Ashbury like, piling into pads and living freaking basic,
   you understand, on greasy mattresses on the floor that the filthiest spade
   walkup in Fillmore wouldn't have, and slopping up soda pop and shit out of
   the same bottle, just passing it around from mouth to mouth, not being
   hung up on that old American plumbing&hygiene thing, you understand, even
   grokking the weird medieval vermin diseases that are flashing through
   every groin-crab lice! you know that thing, man, where you first look down
   at your lower belly and see these little scars, they look like, little
   scabs or something, tiny little mothers, and like you pick one, root it
   out, and it starts crawling] Oh shit! and then they're all crawling and
   you start exploring your mons pubis and your balls and they're alive. It's
   like a jungle you never saw before, in your own crotch, your own shag, and
   it's alive, a freaking bestiary, in fact, the little bastids, like
   soft-shell crabs that could dance on the head of a pin, and you keeping
   picking them off but every time you look you see eight more creeping over
   the veld and the savannas and you practically go blind staring at the
   little Africa down there between your legs and it's A-200 Time, man-A-200!
   Pyrinate Liquid-the only solution-that little green bottle, man! do you
   remember] and so on. .. Nostalgia for the mud!... The ...

   ... Life ... Even down in a place like La Jolla, in north San Diego, the
   poshest resort on the Pacific beaches, T---, one of the great young
   surfers, turns up one day with a three-wheel trunk motorcycle, the kind
   drugstore delivery boys use, and he pulls up into one driveway after
   another and the kids come out and-help yourself.-and he's got every pill
   and capsule you ever imagined, plus lids of grass, and ... The Life is on.
   Even devoted surfing cliques like the Pump House Gang-the mysterioso sea
   and all that!-are easing into The Life, and some move up the beach from
   the Pump House, away from the everlasting sets of goodsurfing waves they
   used to wait for like Phrygian sacristans, up from the Pump House to the
   Parking Lot, where they sit in cars with special amethyst-tinted windows
   and grok in fullness the Pacific sun as it comes through the weird glass
   and the cops wonder what in hell they're doing in cars all day instead of
   being on the beach, and they roust them and search the cars and find
   nothing, but warn-We know you kids are drinking beer out here... Beer! .
   .. One of the Pump House Gang leaders, Artie, pulls into Haight-Ashbury,
   because this is the underground word in The Life in all the high schools
   in California already, even though Haight-Ashbury has never been mentioned
   in the newspapers ... Haight-Ashbury! they know the whole new legend,
   right down to Owsley, now known as The White Rabbit, the paranoid acid
   genius . . . Artie pulls into Haight-Ashbury, walking along amid those
   endless staggers of bay windows, slums with a view, and who is sitting out
   on a curbing on Haight Street but J--- of Pump House days gone by, just
   sitting there with an Emporium shopping bag beside him.

   "Hi, J---!"

   J---just barely glances at him and says, "Oh, hi, Artie," as if naturally
   they're both in Haight-Ashbury and have been for years, and then he says,
   "Here, have a lid," and he reaches in the shopping bag and just offers him
   a whole lid of grass, free, out in the open .. . Artie looks up Anchovy's
   communal pad. Anchovy, who was little known in La Jolla in the old surfing
   days, he wasn't a surfer, is now a beautiful person and the good shepherd
   in Haight-Ashbury for all the La Jolla kids up here. Artie makes the
   rounds in Haight-Ashbury and it's ... a carnival!-everybody working for
   the Management in wondrous ways, popping Owsley LSD up from out of Pez
   candy dispensers, smoking grass, taking methedrine and fucking and
   carrying on wherever and whenever they feel like it, on the streets
   practically ... Later Anchovy has love-ins called Trans-Love Airways going
   on the San Diego campus of the University, and everybody is freaking out
   on the grass to the loudest rock 'n' roll in history and smoking grass in
   a goddamned green cloud, f'r chrissake, and taking movies of it all for
   ... the archives, and they're allied now with real people, Good People, a
   motorcycle band known as the Pallbearers, the local version ... of the
   Hell's Angels ... ah umm-mmm ... and Artie leans up against a tree smoking
   a fake joint rolled of plain Bull Durham tobacco, because you got to look
   like you're into the thing at all times ... but, in fact, it is getting to
   be too much... About nine different constabularies stage a mass raid to
   wipe out the dope plague from the San Diego County high schools and they
   pounce on La Colonia Tijuana, which means the Tijuana Slums, name here in
   La Jolla underground for the apartments a lot of people in The Life share
   this summer near the beach, and some good Pump House souls are busted, but
   that is The Life, the world divided into surfer heads and surfer lames...
   Besides, it was a laugh and a half, the look on the cops' faces when they
   saw the ceilings of La Colonia Tijuana, canopied in huge laceworks of
   interlocked pop-top rings off beer cans billowing in such groovy silvery
   ripples of grokkable reflections...

   The Probation Generation! Not the Lost Generation or the Beat Generation
   or the Silent Generation or even the Flower Generation, but the Probation
   Generation, with kids busted right and left up and down the coast for
   grass, and all get off the first time, on probation-What's probation!-with
   this millennium at hand, and it is, because there's no earthly stopping
   this thing. It's like a boulder rolling down a hill-you can watch it and
   talk about it and scream and say Shit! but you can't stop it. It's just a
   question of where it's going to go. Right now there are two ways it can go
   in Haight-Ashbury. One is the Buddhist direction, the Leary thing. There
   are good heads like Michael Bowen and Gary Goldhill who want to start the
   League for Spiritual Discovery here and pull the whole movement together
   into one church and give it a focus and even legal respectability. And
   they have given up much for this dream. Goldhill is a beautiful head! He
   is an Englishman who was writing this experimental stuff for TV in England
   and the BBC sent him to the U.S. to apply for a big grant, a Guggenheim or
   something, and he took a vacation in Mexico and ran into some American
   heads in San Miguel de Allende who said, Man, you got to come back here
   when the rainy seasons start and take some magic mushrooms, and damned if
   they didn't send him a telegram in Guadalajara or wherever - rains came
   mushrooms up-and he returned out of curiosity and took the mushrooms, just
   as Leary had, and discovered the Management and gave up all, all the TV
   BBC game and dedicated himself to The Life ... And Bowen has an apartment
   with India-print spreads lining the walls and couches on the floor and
   hand-made Indian teapots and cups and three small crystals suspended from
   the ceiling by almost invisible threads and picking up lights like jewels
   in the air, a place devoid of all the shit and gadgetry of the modern
   American plastic life, for, as Leary has said, a home should be a place of
   purity that the Gautama Buddha himself could walk into from 485 b.c. and
   feel at home. For some day grass must grow again in the streets, in
   pastoral purity, for life is shit, a duress of bad karmas, endless fight
   against catastrophe, which is to be warded off finally only by utter
   purification of the soul, utter passivity in which one becomes nothing...
   but a vessel of the All... the All-one ...

   ... as against the Kesey direction, which has become the prevailing life
   style of Haight-Ashbury . . . beyond catastrophe . . . like, picking up on
   anything that works and moves, every hot wire, every tube, ray, volt,
   decibel, beam, floodlight and combustion of American flag-flying neon
   Day-Glo America and winding it up to some mystical extreme carrying to the
   western-most edge of experience-

   The Day... was coming, but the movement lacked a single great charismatic
   leader, a visionary who could pull the whole thing together. Leary was too
   old, heading toward fifty years old, and too remote somehow, holed up in
   Millbrook, N.Y. As for Kesey-he is swamp-bound in exile in some
   alligator-infested Mexican hideaway, it was presumed ... Yet here come the
   Merry Pranksters pulling back into San Francisco from Mexico via their own
   route ... The Calliope Company gives them their Warehouse on Harriet
   Street to live in for a month, a place Tara wants to turn into a theater,
   an old garage in an abandoned hotel in the Tenderloin where Jack Dempsey
   used to train in a special amphitheater with a sloping wooden floor now
   all fully claimed by the vermin and the winos-but Colored Power! and the
   Day-Glo bus and the Pranksters come rolling in, and good heads start
   gathering around in the Day-Glo gloom of the place, like the Telepathic
   Kid who gets unspoken messages-we need beds- and he climbs a ladder and
   starts rigging the platforms on the theater scaffolding in here ... as the
   Pranksters assemble from all over, Hermit-back from dark adventures in
   Napa Valley; Stewart Brand and Lois Jennings-back from the Southwest; Paul
   Foster-back from India ... all joining the veteran Mexican band, Cassady,
   Babbs, Gretch, Mountain Girl, Faye and the children, Ram Rod, Hagen, Page,
   Doris Delay, Zonker, Black Maria ...

   ... and all at once it dawns, the main truth, spreading over the jungle
   drums all over the Haight-Ashbury: Kesey himself is back, too ::::: The
   Man ::::

   SUCH WAS THE BACKGROUND OF THE UNDERGROUND SUMMIT meeting between Kesey
   and Owsley. It was as crazy a scene as anybody ever dreamed up. For a
   start, it was in the apartment of Margot St. James, which looks like she
   once read a historical novel about a Roman banquet. The meeting began to
   shape up as a debate. Owsley, the White Rabbit, was sitting over here-and
   Kesey, the Fugitive, was sitting over there. Owsley was dressed like an
   uptown head-long hair, a dueling shirt with billowing sleeves, a
   sleeveless jacket, and beads, amulets, mandalas hanging down over his
   chest, tight pants and high boots. Kesey had on his buckskin shirt and
   tight ginger-corduroy pants and the Guadalajara red Prankster boots-and he
   was in a chuckling, giggling mood. Standing around, along with Margot,
   were various Pranksters, Haight-Ashbury heads, San Francisco State heads,
   Berkeley heads, and two or three Hell's Angels, including Terry the Tramp.

   Kesey presents his theory of going "beyond acid." You find what you came
   to find when you're on acid and we've got to start doing it without acid;
   there's no use opening the door and going through it and then always going
   back out again. We've got to move on to the next step... This notion has
   Owsley slightly freaked, naturally. He has his voice wound all the way up:

   "Bullshit, Kesey! It's the drugs that do it. It's all the drugs, man. None
   of it would have happened without the drugs"-and so forth.

   Kesey keeps cocking his head to one side and giggling in the upcountry
   manner and saying: "No, it's not the drugs. In fact"-chuckle, giggle-"I'm
   going to tell everyone to start doing it without the drugs"-and so forth.

   People in the room start following this exchange like a tennis match, the
   heads batting this way and that. One unfortunate kid from San Francisco
   State happens to get into this state of obsession about one foot in front
   of Terry the Tramp. He keeps edging closer and batting his head around,
   and edging in closer, until he is standing in front of Terry the Tramp and
   cutting off his line of vision, which is bad enough, but then he has to
   take out a cigarette and light it, all of this practically in Terry the
   Tramp's face, or within a couple of feet of it, which is all the same to
   Terry.

   One billow comes up from the kid's cigarette and Terry the Tramp says,
   "Hey, man, how about a cigarette?"

   He says it with a tone you have to hear to fully comprehend. It is the
   patented Hell's Angels tone of soft grinning menace, kind of like the tone
   the second-story man uses on the watchdog, "Come here, fel-la... (so I can
   squash your head with this brick)." He says it soft, but it stops the
   whole room like High Noon.

   "Hey, man, how about a cigarette?"

   The kid smells debacle in the air. It registers from his solar plexus to
   his earthworm lips. But he hasn't quite figured out what it's all about.
   He just hurries into his shirt pocket and takes out the cigarettes and
   shakes one free and offers it to Terry the Tramp, who takes it and puts it
   in his pocket. Then he says, with the soft grin menace smile snaking up
   out of his beard:

   "How about another one?"

   The kid mumbles O.K. and fishes into his pocket and shakes loose another
   cigarette and Terry the Tramp takes it and puts it into his pocket. The
   kid, meantime, is frozen, like a rabbit frozen by the eyebeams of a
   cougar. He knows it is time to split, but he can't move. He is stricken
   and fascinated by his own impending destruction. It's like there is
   nothing to do but play out the sequence. He puts the cigarettes back in
   his pocket- and precisely then, naturally, comes again the milky atropine:

   "How about another one?"

   O.K.-and Terry the Tramp takes another one and the kid puts them back in
   his pocket and Terry the Tramp says,

   "How about another one?"

   O.K.-and Terry the Tramp takes another one, and now every eye in the room
   watches the rabbit and the snake, panting for the next broken hyoid
   bone-how many cigarettes does the kid have left, fans? Eight-ten?-and what
   then, after all the cigarettes are gone?

   How about your shirt?

   O.K.-uhhh-

   How about your boots?

   O.K.-uhh-

   How about your pants?

   O.K.-uhhh-

   And now your HIDE, mother!

   My ... hide!

   Your very HIDE, mother! Your very ASS ! The last vestige of your pride and
   honor!  AAARRRRRRRCHHHHHHHHH!!!! ... and his bones crunched like baked
   baby ortolans ...

   Everyone in the room can see the entire movie in an instant, like some
   crucible of the prison brutes, Terry the Tramp slowly picking meat off the
   turkey-fascinating!-stay tuned in for next week's broken hyoid bone!-

   -until a couple of Pranksters intervene, with overtones of He's just a
   baby, Terry, don't snuff him. So the Kesey-Owsley debate resumed.

   It was a small moment. No heads were broken. Certainly, the Angels have
   done worse. The kid even got away that night with a whole half a pack of
   cigarettes. Yet it stuck in the throat. One way or another, the Hell's
   Angels came to symbolize the side of the Kesey adventure that panicked the
   hip world. The Angels were too freaking real. Outlaws? they were outlaws
   by choice, from the word go, all the way out in Edge City. Furthur! The
   hip world, the vast majority of the acid heads, were still playing the
   eternal charade of the middle-class intellectuals-Behold my wings!
   Freedom! Flight!-but you don't actually expect me to jump off that cliff,
   do you? It is the eternal game in which Clement Attlee, bald as Lenin,
   lively as a toy tank, yodels blood to the dockworkers of Liverpool-and
   dies buried in striped pants with a magenta sash across his chest and a
   coin with the Queen's likeness upon each eyelid. In their heart of hearts,
   the heads of Haight-Ashbury could never stretch their fantasy as far out
   as the Hell's Angels. Overtly, publicly, they included them in-suddenly,
   they were the Raw Vital Proles of this thing, the favorite minority,
   replacing the spades. Privately, the heads remained true to their class,
   and to its visceral panics ... One trouble with this Kesey was, he really
   meant it.

   but! step up the movie, he suddenly turned up one afternoon at Ed
   McClanahan's creative-writing class at Stanford. He sticks his head in the
   door and smiles from underneath a cowboy hat and says, "Happy birthday, Ed
   ..." In truth, it is his birthday. Then he comes on in, the Fugitive in
   buckskin shirt and red Guadalajara boots; tells the students why he wants
   to move beyond writing to more ... electric forms... then vanishes, that
   damned Pimpernel.

   Then the Haight-Ashbury heads held the first big "be-in," the Love
   Festival on October 7, on the occasion of the California law against LSD
   going into effect. Thousands of heads piled in, in high costume, ringing
   bells, chanting, dancing ecstatically, blowing their minds one way and
   another and making their favorite satiric gesture to the cops, handing
   them flowers, burying the bastids in tender fruity petals of love. Oh
   christ, Tom, the thing was fantastic, a freaking mindblower, thousands of
   high-loving heads out there messing up the minds of the cops and everybody
   else in a fiesta of love and euphoria. And who pops up in the middle of it
   all, down in the panhandle strip of the Golden Gate Park, but the
   Pimpernel, in Guadalajara boots and cowboy suit, and just as the word gets
   to ricocheting through the crowd real good-Kesey's here! Kesey's here-he
   vanishes, accursed Pimpernel.

   Just in case there was anybody left who didn't get the Gestalt here, Kesey
   made his big move in the press. He met with Donovan Bess, a reporter for
   the San Francisco Chronicle, and gave him the story of his flight to
   Mexico and his plans, as The Fugitive. The story was a real barn burner,
   Secret Interview with Fugitive Wanted by FBI, with all the trimmings,
   awash in screamers all across the San Francisco Chronicle. The line that
   captured all imaginations was where Kesey said:

   "I intend to stay in this country as a fugitive, and as salt in J. Edgar
   Hoover's wounds."

   Then-this next prank was beautiful. A TV interview. The Fugitive on TV,
   while all, F B. Eyes and everyone, watch helpless as the full face of the
   Fugitive, Kesey, beams forth into every home and bar and hospital and
   detective bureau in the Bay Area. It was beautiful to even think about,
   this prank. It was set up, much sly planning, with Roger Grimsby, a San
   Francisco television personality, on Station KGO, the local ABC outlet.
   The fantasy was that Grimsby would tape an interview with Kesey in a
   hideaway in the Portrero section of San Francisco, which was far away from
   both Haight-Ashbury and North Beach, and then put it on the air a couple
   of days later, October 20, a Friday. This fantasy came off like a dream.
   Grimsby taped the interview, and all was cool, and on Friday afternoon
   Kesey's face beamed into every home, bar, hospital and detective bureau,
   saying it all again, in person:

   "I intend to stay in this country as a fugitive, and as salt in J. Edgar
   Hoover's wounds. .."

   See the very hunted coons

   Salt J. Edgar Hoover's wounds!

   Yah! the cops and robbers game.

   All that remains to be done is the grand finale. Fugitive Extraordinaire!
   In this fantasy Kesey will present himself in person, in the
   flesh-Kesey!-only inches away from the greatest collection of cops in the
   history of the drug scene and then

   Vanish

   like Mandrake. The Pranksters will hold a monster trips festival, the Acid
   Test of all times, the ultimate, on Halloween, in San Francisco's largest
   hall, Winterland, for all the heads on the West Coast or coast to coast
   and galaxy to galaxy. Naturally, the cops will converge on this hideous
   bacchanal to watch for Kesey and other felons and bad actors. But of
   course! An integral part of the fantasy! It will be a masked ball, this
   Test. Nobody will know which freak is who. At the midnight hour, Kesey,
   masked and disguised in a Superhero costume, on the order of Captain
   America of the Marvel Comics pantheon, will come up on stage and deliver
   his vision of the future, of the way "beyond acid." Who is this
   apocalyptic- Then he will rip off his mask-Why-it's Ken Kee-zee!-and as
   the law rushes for him, he will leap up on a rope hanging down from the
   roof at center stage and climb, hand over hand, without even using his
   legs, with his cape flying, straight up, up, up, up through a trap door in
   the roof, to where Babbs will be waiting with a helicopter, Captain
   Midnight of the U.S. Marines, and they will ascend into the California
   ozone looking down one last time into the upturned moon faces of all the
   put-on, nonplused, outwitted, befuddled befreaked shucked! constables and
   sleuths Yeah! Yeah! Right! Right! Right!

   right right right right an even even even even even world twenty-five
   minutes after the Grimsby TV show Friday afternoon, October 20, Kesey and
   Hassler driving out of San Francisco on the Bayshore freeway, toward Palo
   Alto, in an old red panel truck. The current fantasy . . . this movie is
   too real, Mommy-but they have actually pulled it off. They have just been
   in town in the hideaway watching Kesey the Fugitive on TV, and this prank
   was too beautiful. The FBI and all cops everywhere shucked in the most
   public galling way. The sun slants down on the Bayshore freeway in the
   afternoon and all the shiny black-shoe multitudes are out in their
   300-horsepower fantasy cars heading into the rush hour, out the freeway,
   toward the waiting breezeway slots. It's actually peaceful, this rush hour

   We pulled it off

   thousands of cars sailing up the swooping expressway like so many Salt
   Flat Futur-o-matics with taillight bands like hard red candy ... It's
   relaxing, the rush hour is, and hypnotic, it drones, and it winks like red
   hard candy with the sun shining through it, and the sun shines in Kesey's
   side of the panel truck, very relaxing, and he takes off his disguise, the
   cowboy hat and dark glasses

   See the very hunted coons

   Salt j. edgar hoover's wounds

   Hassler, driving, vaguely aware of the cars floating by in the rush hour,
   shiny hulls with so many shaved globes sticking up inside ...

   Kesey!

   Suddenly coming up on his left Hassler sees a car full of shiny haircut
   faces, jammed full of them, all staring at them-Hassler and Kesey-and now
   gray Alumicron arms flapping out the

   window, stabbing and motioning Pull Over, much grimacing and shouting
   soundlessly into the slipstream of the rush hour, and one with his wallet
   dangling out the window, flapping his badge at them

   Run! Split! Vanish!

   But there is no place to vanish to. It is all clear in a flash-trapped in
   the rush hour for a start-and the panel truck can't outrun their sedan
   anyway. Opposite side pickoff!-Hassler tries to squeeze between cars and
   lose them that way, like a basketball play, but it's no use. The cops keep
   floating abreast, grimacing and flapping, and drifting back and pulling
   even again

   There !

   Kesey motions to the shoulder of the expressway, by an embankment and
   Hassler cuts over there, skids to a stop

   Thrash !

   Kesey out the door and plunges over the guardrail and down the embankment,
   with the dust flying . . .

   Hassler just sits there as the sedan skids to a stop in front of him,
   cutting him off. Seems like twenty doors fly open, haircut faces and
   gray-Alumicron bodies popping out in every direction, leaping over the
   guardrail-

   All in shiny black shoes

   One orders Hassler out of the panel truck and Hassler gets out and sits
   down on the edge of the freeway. Very strange. The great swarm of cars
   with hard-candy tails keeps sailing past, hypnotically. Hassler gets into
   the lotus position, sitting cross-legged on the asphalt, looking straight
   ahead. Three sets of

   Shiny black FBI shoes

   standing around him now. They all have these shiny black shoes on. Then
   one of them goes back to the sedan and comes back with a flare gun and
   stands over him with that. Hassler wonders if he intends to shoot him with
   a flare. A very Day-Glo death. Thread-soul, the causal body, ablation,
   Upanishads, Krishnamurti, the karmic vestiture of the soul, the nirvanic
   consciousness-it all runs together right here, like a tinned stew, and
   Hassler isn't even high. On the other side of the expressway, on the edge
   of the bay, great fat seagulls are wheeling in the air in a great weird O
   pattern, coasting down below the level of the highway, then struggling up,
   dripping garbage out of their gullets, but a nice pattern, all in all-

   The Visitacion Drain

   It's the Visitacion Drain they've picked to work out their karma in ...
   ah, we're synched up this afternoon .. . and the gulls wax fat gulping
   garbage at the drain and grease a slippery fat O in the sky and it occurs
   to Hassler that today is his twenty-seventh birthday.

   Skidding down the embankment chocking up dust like in a Western the blur
   of the Drain flats out beyond Kesey vaults over an erosion fence at the
   bottom of the embankment

   Ri-i-i-i-i-ip

   a picket catches his pants in the crotch rips out the in-seams of both
   pants legs most neatly flapping on his legs like Low Rent cowboy chaps
   running and flapping through the Visitacion flats poor petered-out
   suckmuck marginal housing development last blasted edge of land you can
   build houses on before they just sink into the ooze and the compost poor
   Visitacion Drain kids playing ball in the last street before the ooze runs
   flapping through their ballgame stare at him

   And at the ghost on my heels?

   like the whole world turns into an endless kids' ballgame on the edge of
   the ooze thousands of Drain kids furling toward the horizon like an urchin
   funnel

   And that Alumicron blur behind me?

   shiny black shoes tusking up behind him stops stock still in the
   Visitacion Drain and

   Gotcha!

   in the cops and robbers game.

                                    chapter

                                     XXVII

                                 The Graduation

   THEY HAVE KESEY ON THREE FELONIES: THE ORIGINAL Conviction in San Mateo
   County for possession of marijuana, which he never served time on; the
   arrest for possession in San Francisco, after which he fled to Mexico; and
   a Federal charge of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. A felon and a
   fugitive ... who; yes; was going to rub the FBI's nose in it for good
   measure ... and all about dope, at that... and throw away the key ... For
   three days they shuttle Kesey back and forth between County and Federal
   courthouses and jails in Redwood City and San Francisco. It will take a
   miracle to even get him out on bail, an inspiration, a vision ::::: ummm,
   a vision ::::: we can work it out ::::: Kesey's lawyers, Pat Hallinan,
   Brian Rohan and Paul Robertson, have a vision. The next morning they're in
   the courtroom in Redwood City at a bail hearing. The new style of
   Courtroom Modern, this courtroom, all great lineless slabs of blonde wood,
   and lowslung like ... the friendly banks of the suburbs. All very sunny
   under the fluorescent tubes. Kesey sits at the defense table wearing a
   blue workshirt. Robertson is on his feet telling the judge about a certain
   vision Mr. Kesey has had, of "beyond acid," an inspiration, a miracle, a
   light he has seen, although never mind the details of the beach in
   Manzanillo, not... those lights... In any case ... Mr. Kesey has a very
   public-spirited plan ... He has returned voluntarily from exile in his
   safe harbor, to risk certain arrest and imprisonment, in order to call a
   mass meeting of all LSD takers, past, present and potential, for the
   purpose of telling them to move beyond this pestilent habit of taking LSD
   .. . Robertson's talking a streak. It's a grand speech. Kesey is sitting
   up straight at the table staring blue bolts at the judge. But Robertson's
   words are like a fog. Kesey disappears in the soup, he reappears in a
   mist, undergoing metamorphosis before your very eyes. He's found religion,
   contrition, redemption, the error of his ways, and now he's going to tell
   The Youth his sad lesson ... Faye and the kids are in the audience. Also
   many of their old Perry Lane friends, Jim and Dorothea Fadiman, Ed
   McClanahan, Jim Woltman, and some others ... Several will stake their
   homes as bail security, $35,000 worth ... Repentance and redemption are
   sailing around the courtroom like cherubim. All us reporters are
   scribbling away ... Now Kesey is standing up facing the judge with his
   arms folded and the judge is giving him a lecture ... He may be a great
   literary lion and a romantic figure to some misguided youth but to this
   court he is a childish ass, an egotist who never grew up, a ... The judge
   is pouring it on, pouring it down his throat like cod-liver oil, but it's
   obvious it's just a buildup to saying he's going to grant bail anyway
   under the circumstances... Nevertheless Kesey is burning ... You can see
   him setting his jaw and getting ready to move his lips... God knows
   Hallinan and Robertson can see it. They're crouched beside him like
   bandits. The first peep out of him they're going to grab him around the
   throat... Keep your mouth shut, damn it. Don't blow it now. It's only
   cod-liver oil... But the judge has finished and it's over. He's out on
   bail in San Mateo County.

   The whole dam breaks after that. The FBI drops the Federal charge of
   unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. All of a sudden they don't seem very
   interested in the case, despite the salt in J. Edgar Hoover's wounds and
   the rest of it. Then back in San Francisco, and Kesey is standing in front
   of the judge in a faded sport shirt, work pants and boots. The judge has a
   terrific speech ready, saying this case has been blown up out of
   proportions in the press and it is only a common dope case as far as he is
   concerned, and Kesey is no dragon, just an ordinary jackass ... and Kesey
   is starting to say something and Hallinan and Rohan are crouched for the
   garrote, but again it's over and Kesey is out on bail in San Francisco,
   too. It's unbelievable. He's out after only five days.

   In the San Francisco jail

   Before he got out on bail

   Kesey met a kid with magic fingernails.

   "Take a lick," said the kid

   And everybody did.

   They all licked his nails and blew their lids.

   Twenty-seven psyches

   Going off like Nike

   Missiles through the lye-scoured

   Concrete skyways of the San Francisco jail.

   The kid had LSD on his magic fingernails.

   Now-

   Kesey told this story

   To the local news reporters

   Who pressed around him in the courtroom,

   After the hearing on his bail,

   Just to prove how hopeless

   Was the drive to stamp out dope

   With things like cops and jails.

   Try and stop a kid with magic fingernails !

   The headlines said

   LSD ORGY IN THE SAN FRANCISCO Jail!

   Ah...

   Certain local heads cried Judas.

   Finked on a stash, this Judas!

   While he himself so shrewdly

   Copped out of jail, on bail.

   A finking fingernail stash betrayal!

   If the truth be known-

   These good hearts flapped in fibrillation.

   They feared the rogue vibrations

   From the freaking Acid Graduation

   Kesey and the Pranksters planned;

   Their freaking Day-Glo last round-up in Winterland.

   Like, I mean,

   You know,

   Can't you see it coming:

   Ten thousand children of the flowers and grass and acid, speed

   and poppers, yellow jackets, amyl nitrate,

   Ten thousand heads, freaks, beats, hippy-dippies, teeny-boppers

   descending from the crest of Haight Street

   Tinkling, temple bells, rattling, donkey beads, reeking, grass,

   shuffling, elf boots, swarming prostrate

   Before the returning Prophet in the bowels of Winterland.

   All of psychedelphia moaning to the polyphonic droning of the

   Merry Prankster band!

   It's too easy for this headline-blazing superhero

   This amazing Cagliostro Elmer Gantry Day-Glo Nero-

   ON THE TOP FLOOR OF THE RUSSIAN EMBASSY, IN AN Extremely crummy brown room
   ... It looks inflammable, or spontaneous-combustible, the next cough,
   maybe, and it's all up in here. Jack the Fluke sits up in bed, namely, a
   mattress on the floor, with his back against the wall. .. wearing nothing
   except his cabbie's cap and the grizzle on his face and the grizzle on his
   Camembert chest... a brown blanket pulled up to his waist... Take a look
   at that! if you want to know about Kesey. A large message tacked up on the
   wall on a sheet of drawing paper:

   Dear Ken,

   The boys in the

   tank say hello.

   They want to know

   about their money. should

   they ask you or the

   Judge or who?

   Sandra, the girl from Bucks County, sits in a clump at the foot of the
   mattress. She is a very pale, tender little teenage clump. A single
   morsel, gone at one gulp, sitting under the room's one article of
   furniture, a bridge lamp, no longer goofing off the radio, just sitting in
   a teenage clump and listening to Jack tell me about the letter:

   "Oh man, there were a lot of good heads hassled and busted after Kesey
   told about that."

   "You mean the cops-"

   "The very ones. It was a bad scene. Like there's a lot of cats up here who
   are not enchanted with Ken Kesey. They sent him this letter."

   Well, obviously they haven't, because there it is, up on the wall. But the
   thought is there ...

   Creaks on the inflammable stairs, and into the room sidles a dark little
   guy in a T-shirt and jeans carrying a round plastic box of cheese spread
   and a knife in a scabbard-

   "Jack!" he says in this weird whisper

   -one of those long knives with a lot of fancy mother-of-pearl on the
   handle that you see in a Chinatown souvenir shop.

   "It was a bad scene," Jack the Fluke tells me. He ignores the guy-

   "Jack ... look at this," says the kid.

   "That's nice, Frenchy," says Jack.

   "Jack ... it's beautiful, " says Frenchy.

   "Like there's a lot of cats up here," Jack says to me again-

   "It's beautiful," says Frenchy. "Jack-you know where there's any
   morphine?"

   "No," says Jack, then resumes: "Like there's a lot of cats up here-"

   "It's a beautiful thing," says Frenchy.

   "-who are not enchanted with Ken Kesey and they sent him this letter."

   "Jack-"

   And Frenchy hunkers down on the floor and opens the cheese spread and
   pulls the knife out of the scabbard and sinks the blade into it. Quite a
   blade! a foot long and engraved with Chinese demons. He wipes gobs of
   cheese spread onto his tongue with the blade. Sandra sits silent in a
   clump, grooving on the full life. Jack raps on about perfidy in high
   places . . .

   I don't know what the reference to money is-"they want to know about their
   money." But the gist of it is clear enough. Kesey has sold out to keep
   from getting a five-year sentence or worse. Next he'll nail it down by
   calling all the kids to Winterland and telling them to stop taking LSD ...
   Freaking copout ...

   It's quite a mess for Kesey, of course. If he had lectured back at the
   judges like a Superhero, that would have been the end of everything,
   probably, with him salted away for many years. On the other hand, if he
   just stares back Orientally as the current fantasy of "beyond acid" is put
   forth, he looks like a cop-out in Haight-Ashbury ...

   All those good-loving heads... they've been having quite a time for
   themselves... a summer of euphoria, the millennium, in fact, LSD and
   hundreds of beautiful people already on the scene, and no more little
   games. They would just spread out like a wave over the world and end all
   the bull-shit, drown it in love and awareness, and nothing could stop
   them. I'll have to hand it to the heads. They really want to end the
   little games. Their hearts are pure. I never found more than one or two
   cynics or hustlers among them. But now that the moment is at hand,
   everyone is wondering ... Hmmmmmmm ... who is going to lead the way and
   hold the light? Then just one little game starts, known as politics...
   Hmmmmm ... As I say, their hearts are pure! Nevertheless, Chet Helms and
   the Family Dog have their thing, Bill Graham has his thing, the Grateful
   Dead have theirs, the Diggers have theirs, the Calliope Company have
   theirs, Bowen has his, even Gary Goldhill... It's a little like the
   socialist movement in New York after World War I-the Revolution is
   imminent, as all know and agree, and yet, Christ, everybody and his
   brother has a manifesto, the Lovestonites, the Dubinsky Socialists, the
   CPUSA (Bolshevik), the Wobblies, everybody has his own typewriters and
   mimeograph machines and they're all cranking away like mad and fuming over
   each other's mistranslations of the Message . . . Not that the heads in
   Haight-Ashbury are wrangling with each other yet, but what do they do
   about Kesey? Just sit back and let him and the Pranksters do their thing?
   Let them try to turn a lot of impressionable kids off LSD, the way the
   newspapers say he intends? Or let him suddenly make a big power play at
   Winterland and take over the whole movement? Politics, in a word ...

   And the Pranksters ... by and by ... I find them in the Calliope garage on
   Harriet Street, the old garage, the ex-pie factory in the bottom of the
   old hotel. I kept peeking around in the crazy gloom of the place, amid all
   the scabid wood and sour corners and ratty blankets and scaffoldings and
   beat-up theater seats and the luminous bus hulking in its own grease and
   the rotting mattresses where people stretched out and slept and the Shell
   station up the corner where everyone copped urinations, and I couldn't
   figure out what they had to be so exultant about. It beat me. As I look
   back on it, they were all trying to tell me ... Hassler with his discourse
   on the world full of games and futile oppositioning and how the Pranksters
   meant to show the world how to live ... with his toothbrush case
   shimmering ... He was a kind man! He was trying to give me the whole
   picture at once. It wasn't about cops and robbers in Mexico, it was
   about...

   Pranksters arriving from far and wide . . . The old Schism forgotten ...
   Paul Foster back from India, looking emaciated, his mustache and mutton
   chops gone, his head shaved, but with the great God Rotor roaring and
   digging away . . . Page telling me about huaraches... Mountain Girl, Doris
   Delay, The Hermit, Freewheeling Frank the Hell's Angel, Cassady flipping
   his sledgehammer, Babbs, Gretch, George Walker ... Zonker coming in with
   an Arab headdress as Torrence of Arabia ... Finally Kesey pulling in, Faye
   and the kids coming out... The Flag People, the bus glowing, the mystic
   fog rising ...

   IN THE STUDIO OF JOHN BARTHOLOMEW TUCKER'S  TELEVISION show, station KPIX,
   on Van Ness Avenue, I'm sitting in the studio audience up in the gloom
   behind the black backsides of the spotlights, the cameras, the dollies,
   the coils of wire ... Well, this is going to be fun-

                               The Danger of LSD

   -coming on in big letters on the screen of the monitor sets in the studio,
   with a drawing of three sugar cubes under it... the symbol of LSD, of
   course, like four X's XXXX, for whiskey,... and the voice-over saying

   "... and author Ken Kesey ..."

   Out in the clearing, beyond the jungle of light stands and wires and the
   rest of it, in a big pool of light, there's Kesey in his buckskin shirt
   and red Guadalajara boots sitting in one of those milky-white
   fiberglass-coated Saarinen swivel chairs that TV interview shows go for
   ... and Tucker, whose show it is, looking California Ivy League... and his
   other guest, Frankie Randall, looking sort of Las Vegas Yachtsman, as if
   any moment he is going to tell a long story about something very
   frustrating that happened to his El Dorado convertible in a parking lot in
   L.A. You can see this show has balance, as they say ... It fills up your
   head like a daydream ... brain candy ... a little talk with Randall about
   the Persian Room and dining at Sardi's and lying on the sands at
   Malibu-"Well, where do you go from here, Frankie!" "Well, I'll be at Lake
   Tahoe next week, John!"-and then, gravely, he'll bring on the elder
   statesman of psychedelphia, talking about the dangers of LSD and telling
   the kids to turn off, as if Kesey were an ex-Communist, reformed and
   returned from the class wars, with a few sizzling stories and then a
   moral. Just the ticket! a whiff of the dope dens and then a cold shower.

   "Well, tell me, Ken, could you give some idea of what an LSD trip is
   like?"

   "Yeah, it blows you out of your gourd."

   Tucker stares at him-

   "Well-now, you're-going to tell all the people not to take it any more, is
   that correct?"

   "I'm going to tell them to move on to the next step."

   "The next step?"

   "It's time to move on to the next step in the psychedelic revolution. I
   don't know what this is going to be in any way I could just spell out, but
   I know we've reached a certain point but we're not moving any more, we're
   not creating any more, and that's why we've got to move on to the next
   step-"

   The next step?... it keeps going that way ... They can't figure out what
   in the name of Christ this big cowboy is saying... What about the danger,
   man, those sugar cubes we had up there... and down in front of me, amid
   the wires and lights, a technician and a production assistant are
   frantically scrawling away on a big cue board with a marking pencil and
   they thrust it close to Tucker and Kesey, just out of camera range-

             Don't forget about danger of LSD! Say about LSD being

                       DANGEROUS - ESPECIALLY FOR KIDS !

   -and Kesey just looks at them and gives them the biggest, most inscrutable
   upcountry smile, which on the screen looks as though he has suddenly gazed
   off toward an old buddy who is saying, What a shuck, Kee-zee ...

   Later in the day, rolling across the TV screens of San Francisco again,
   Kesey and the Pranksters and the bus pull up to Winterland to look it over
   for the Acid Test Graduation ... TV microphones ... Kesey in Flag People
   coveralls and a ten-gallon straw hat. ..

   "Ken! Ken!" A TV announcer heaves into position. "Ken, could you tell us
   something about the message you're going to have for the kids at this Acid
   Test Graduation?"

   Kesey says, "I'm going to tell them, 'Never trust a-' "

   Braaaaaaaaaaang A huge glob of feedback screels into the microphone-

   "Could you repeat that, Ken?"

   "Braaaaaaaaaaang," says Kesey.

   "Ha-ha. No, what you were saying."

   "Never trust a Prankster," says Kesey. The scene breaks up in a covey of
   Flag People bobbing off the bus...

   Never trust a Prankster!...  Shit! ... That shakes them up all over again
   in Haight-Ashbury, there's no getting around that. A whole new
   inflammation of paranoia. The lunger heads are slithering up and down the
   store fronts on Haight Street. They're hunkered down gabbling in the
   India-print living rooms. The whole thing takes a Stakhanovite left turn.
   Kesey is not a right deviationist but a left deviationist. He's not going
   to cop out by telling the kids to stop taking LSD, that's just the cover
   story. Instead he's going to pull a monster prank that will wreck the
   psychedelic movement once and for all... Well, the acid heads in
   Haight-Ashbury are like a tribe in one respect, anyway, I can see that.
   It's all jungle drums and gossip with them, they love it, they swim in it,
   like fish in a stream in a cave ... A terrific thought bubbles up in the
   universal brain ... The Acid Test Graduation is scheduled for Winterland
   on Monday, October 31, Halloween. The next night the California Democratic
   Party is holding a big rally in Winterland for Governor Brown, who is
   running against Ronald Reagan. Kesey and the Pranksters hold their
   Winterland blast on Halloween. Right? Far from being an "acid graduation,"
   it will be an Acid Test of unbelievable proportions. Electric Kool-Aid
   will rain in the air like a typhoon, swizzle up every vein, 6,000 heads
   smashed out of their nuts, ricocheting off the walls like electric golf
   balls... The sky falls... But that's not all. They won't stop there! these
   maniacs... The Pranksters will smear all the doors, railings, walls,
   chairs, the heating system, the water fountains, with DMSO ... laced with
   LSD ... Dig? ... DMSO is close to being an old alchemical ideal, the
   universal solvent. Put a drop of DMSO on your fingertip and thirty seconds
   later you can taste it in your mouth. It goes right through your skin and
   through your system that fast. DMSO with LSD ... What a vision! The
   following night the entire Democratic Party of California will get turned
   on, zonked out of their apples. Eight thousand emphysematous fatbacked
   Senators, Assemblymen, National Committeemen, National Committeewomen,
   Congressmen, the Governor himself, wailing like banshees, flopping around
   and gurgling and spitting and frying like a pile of insane pancakes,
   whereupon the Deaf Policemen descend on the whole psychedelic movement
   with knouts flailing ...

   Christ! what a stew... Now the heads don't know whether Kesey is selling
   them out or shoving a big Roman candle up the universal arse. They're
   fascinated. They come around the Warehouse and peep into the gloom. Their
   eyes shine at the doorway with a hepatic fever . .. They come into the
   Warehouse, they stare at the bus, they stare at Kesey, Mountain Girl,
   Cassady, Babbs... A whole platoon of them comes in, beads rattling,
   teetering around like gauchos, staring at the bus and going "Wowwwww!
   Wowwwwwww!" and smiling at each other, like, it's so groooovy, and
   suddenly all the Pranksters fall silent. "Cops," says Mountain Girl in
   total disgust. "How do you know?" "Look at their shoes." They have on
   lace-up boots like telephone linesmen. "You could never git heads to wear
   heavy shoes like that," she says. Only a momentary downer, however. The
   fact is, the Pranksters are sailing. They've got the whole town into their
   movie by now, cops and all. Kesey is all over TV, radio, and newspapers.
   He's a celebrity, the perfect celebrity, the Good-Bad Guy, reeking all the
   secret Zea-lot delights of sin but promising to do good. They were all
   over town on the bus, befuddling the communal brain ... Even into
   Fillmore, the big Negro section, with the loudspeakers playing rock 'n'
   roll and American flags flying and a big sign on the bus reading

                                 Colored Power

   moving through the ghetto in a blur of Day-Glo swirls. The spades in
   Fillmore didn't know what the hell to make of that. Were these white
   freaks serious, only they got the term wrong? Or was it a
   shuuuuuuuuuuuck-by the time they figured it out, the bus was long gone,
   wailing off somewhere else. Then the big sign

                              Acid Test Graduation

   went up on the bus, and the bus went wheeling through Haight-Ashbury and
   downtown San Francisco and North Beach and Berkeley advertising the
   world's biggest convocation of all the heads. Pranksters flapping from
   every portal. George Walker up on top on the drums, Page on the electric
   guitar. Mountain Girl hanging out the back of the bus exploding sunballs
   and screaming at the nonplused multitudes on the subject of the race for
   governor and Kesey's various busts

   "Kesey for Governor!"

   "A man of convictions!"

   "He stands on his record!"

   "The idiot's choice!"

   "A joint in every stash!"

   "No hope without dope!"

   They were immune again. The whole freaking town was into the movie. And
   after ...

   . . . Winterland; yes . . . the hardest part of the whole fantasy, as
   usual, has been finding the right place. Winterland is perfect, the
   biggest indoor arena in the city limits, and a tight ship, used for ice
   shows and so on. The Winterland management didn't want to deal directly
   with Kesey and the Pranksters. Maniacs! jailbirds ... That was where Bill
   Graham came in. There was no love lost between Graham and Kesey, but
   Graham agrees to serve as producer, impresario, the sane hand on the
   controls, and sign the contract. Graham's job is to stay up on top of the
   new wave. But it's an aesthetic and moral thing with him, too. He's a
   believer, underneath it all... Hmmmm ... There's Kesey ... Well... Anyway,
   Hallinan and Rohan draw up a contract between Graham and Intrepid Trips,
   Inc. It's signed and a deposit is down, all legal and locked up.

   Then there's the Grateful Dead. Kesey wants them for the Acid Test
   Graduation. They're essential, he says. But the Dead have a contract to
   play at an annual Halloween costume ball at California Hall. Ironically,
   the Pranksters' benefactors, the Calliope Company, were sponsoring it, and
   they had an impresario named Bob McKendrick running it. Kesey and
   McKendrick and a couple of the Calliope Company, Paul Hawken, Michael
   Laton and Bill Tara, are up in an apartment on the top floors of a rickety
   building on Pine Street, all wood slats and bay windows. There are no
   furnishings, just a mattress in the living room. The sun makes a huge
   glare in here. Kesey sits on the mattress and everybody else is hunkered
   down on the floor. Except Mc-Kendrick. He is standing up in the middle of
   the floor like someone dancing on a hot plate. He has on tight black
   pants, black shark toe slip-on shoes, a soft black sweater and open-neck
   shirt.. . dressed Main Stem hipster, in short. He's broken up in the
   glare, twenty-seven parts, all fidgeting.

   "Look, Ken," he's saying, "you're a leader, a prophet, you might say, and
   you have an important message, and I dig that, you know? I respect that. .
   . But I have to think of this in other terms. I'm responsible to a lot of
   people, and there's a lot of money involved."

   Twenty-seven parts!-all moving, doesn't anyone see that this is a main
   chance, this dance at California Hall, in the impresario game. Kesey just
   sits there and keeps working on him like how long is it before he will see
   how it's going to be-Hell, man! join forces with the Pranksters. Move your
   scene to Winterland, co-sponsor it. If he doesn't, everybody on ... The
   Scene will go to Winterland anyway, and he and his whole California Hall
   scene will be wiped out anyway. McKendrick is beside himself. His black
   pants shimmy in the glare. He smells disaster either way. Put me back
   together again! Everyone stares. It's all glare and myopia in here! He
   comes to a stop. He agrees. He pulls out of California Hall, freeing the
   Dead, thrash, crumble-

   -bits and freaking pieces, grumbling. The heads start grumbling about
   Kesey's power play. Kesey's power play. The Grateful Dead ... They've been
   doing all right! Since the Acid Tests they have become a thing, the
   pioneers of the new sound, acid rock, with the record companies beginning
   to sniff around :::: hmm-mmm :::: the very next thing? Freak that. All and
   everyone in one bag now, Winterland.

   Friday night and the Pranksters decide to drop in on the Fillmore. Like,
   well, it's Friday night. Kesey, Cassady, Babbs, Page, about a dozen of
   them, all in the Flag People coveralls, Cassady flipping his sledgehammer.
   The scene around the Fillmore is a freak show for sure. The dance hall is
   set down right in the middle of the Negro slums, at Fillmore and Geary,
   and it's Friday night with a lot of young spades with Stingy-Brim hats on
   out on the street having the usual Friday night on the streets and old
   Negro women doing the groceries for the weekend, liquor stores,
   drugstores, cars inching along, black faces all over the streets. Right in
   the middle of them, the white freaks. Kids in psychedelic dress burbling
   and gaggling up to the Fillmore-Colored Power! the kids have that, all
   right. Kesey and the Pranksters walk up the stairs to the dance hall,
   which is on the second floor. Kesey talks to the ticket seller and the
   ticket taker. There's a big conference. The ticket taker goes upstairs. He
   comes back ... like, very bad vibrations... They can't come in unless they
   buy tickets. .. Graham ... bad vibrations, a freaking insult, in fact. The
   Pranksters go back out on the street to mull that one over. There's a
   Cyclone fence at the rear entrance of the Fillmore with a freaked-out
   chomping police dog behind it... Graham ... Cassady goes off... A few
   minutes later he's back.

   "I ran into Bill Graham," he says. "He was out on the street checking tire
   treads to see if they'd picked up any nickels. I says, 'Bill...' and he
   says, 'Look, Neal, we're in two different worlds. You're a hippie and I'm
   a square. Square.' He did it like this"-and Cassady makes a square in the
   air with his forefingers to show how he did it-" 'You're a hippie and I'm
   a square.' Says, 'I got off the subway in 1955, but you're still on it.
   We're in two different worlds. You're a hippie and I'm a square.' I'm
   telling you, Chief," he says to Kesey, "I had some very negative feelings.
   I remembered what you said about negative feelings, but I had some very
   negative feelings." Kesey laughs, but-

   All day Saturday the Pranksters are working like mad. They're hassling up
   all sorts of equipment, mikes, spots, amplifiers, speakers, strobes, even
   an electronic music machine, all the stuff they had at the Acid Tests and
   more. They can't get into Winterland until Sunday to start rigging it up
   because there's some show in there Saturday night. Anyway, they're working
   en charrette Saturday and into Saturday night... At five o'clock in the
   morning, Sunday, it hits the fan. Kesey's lawyer, Rohan, gets wakened up
   at 5 a.m., at home ... Graham is on the phone, very excited, explaining a
   million things a mile a minute.

   They are having quite a little session up in Graham's office at the
   Fillmore. All night it's been going on. Graham has been wrestling with
   many negative feelings. He knows that term, too. By heart-also Chet Helms
   knows it, and the Grateful Dead, and the Quicksilver Messenger Service,
   and more and more ::::: three fourths of The Scene is here, says Graham,
   the're all over the place, hanging on the walls... Everyone is in a
   terrific sweat. Are we actually going to let Kesey do this thing? pull off
   this debacle? Go :::: beyond acid, whatever that may be, which, whatever
   it is, is no good for anyone here .. . They've hauled out all the
   versions, the cop-out, the power play, the way Kesey twisted McKendrick's
   arm, the DMSO ... the DMSO! . .. That's it! Christ, Bill, can't you see
   ... They're putting pressure on Graham to pull out of the deal. . .
   They've got me by each limb, wild tow trucks heading to the four points of
   the compass... The more they talk, the more urgent it is to do something,
   else, Christ, why have we been here all night... Hope incubates in the
   warm loam of every armpit... Helms has it figured out. Kesey's mentality
   is military. He thinks in terms of power differentials. He's playing the
   desert fox-lure the enemy into your own battleground by doing a turn-face
   claiming you came back to stop kids from taking acid, and when you have
   thousands of these straight people together, turn them on to acid. Kesey's
   playing the tactical deceit and fac,ade game-and so on ... And the Dead
   ... Why should we blow our hard-earned scenes for Kesey? As Ralph Gleason
   the columnist says. .. Kesey's going to blow the whole new San Francisco
   scene for us. And Graham ... I ran into Cassady on the street. He's waving
   this sledgehammer at me like he's going to knock my head off if I don't
   play ball... Many negative feelings. Kesey's an Elmer Gantry, says Graham
   ... That's it! Elmer Gantry, the evangelical demagogue . . . Freaking
   debacle either way ... If he blows it, he blows it for us all. If he
   succeeds, he takes over the whole psychedelic movement and leads it into
   the Elmer Gantry thing, Father Divine, Daddy Grace, Cagliostro, charlatan
   limbo, sledgehammer theocracy, a phosphorescent fascist fandango, King
   Herod spavining the Flower Children, O Fuck & Corruption, G-narl, G-nash,
   Elmer Gantry Cagliostro Day-Glo Nero .. . Stop Kesey ...

   In short, Graham is pulling out of the deal and there will be no Acid Test
   Graduation at Winterland.

   LATE IN THE AFTERNOON IN THE WAREHOUSE - CHRIST, It's dismal in here! The
   place is always a shambles, of course, but now the funk of the day's
   debacle is settling in like a sludge. The vermin are regaining the upper
   hand ... The lice! The pigeon fleas! The roaches! rats! scabies! impetigo!
   clap! piles! herpes! all rising up out of the debris like boils . . .
   Faye, Mountain Girl, Babbs, Gretch, Black Maria, Page, Doris Delay,
   Stewart Brand, Lois, the Hermit, Roy Seburn, Gut the ex-Hell's Angel,
   Kesey's brother Chuck, Zonker-they're all rumbling around in the gloom,
   but they're not Flag People any more, the costumes are off like the war is
   over ... They're gathering around in a circle in folding chairs and old
   theater seats on one side of the bus. .. Acid Test Graduation... The sign
   is still stretched across the whole side of the bus ... Well, shit.. .
   Kesey, in his buckskin shirt again, comes around in the midst of them
   carrying a huge easy chair-stuffed with tiny wings!-over his head-and sets
   it down with the back to the bus and sits down in it-a molting chair-and
   the Prankster circle rings out from him. Kesey stares at a spiral notebook
   he has and then starts talking in a voice so soft I can hardly hear him at
   first... about what has just happened ... about Danny Rifkin and some
   others who came by to tell him they were pulling out of the Winterland
   fantasy.

   "It didn't take long to know they wouldn't change their minds," he says.
   "They won't change because they have too much money involved ... As soon
   as they left, I lay down and I thought about it and then I knew we have
   everything we want right here . . ."

   Right here?

   ". . . in this warehouse, and this is where we're going to do it. We're
   going to have the Graduation here and it's going to be our scene. We have
   a certain number of people we want to get close to us, and they're going
   to be here and it's going to be better than anything we could have done at
   Winterland ..."

   Whistling

   ".. . Here we're on our own grounds, and we can do what we want, for our
   own scene, and we don't have to do any more politicking or compromising.
   We'll do it our own way and we'll be the Bay Area's Superheroes ..."

   Last hole in the sapling sky

   "... One reason it didn't come off was that it was too big and too hot and
   they all got frightened. They all want to be eagles, but they don't want
   to act like eagles, so we're going to have to do it ourselves. We tried to
   do it the other way, but they weren't interested ... So we're going to
   keep it down to those people who are going to make it as tight a scene as
   we can get. They are the kind of people who, if they've got anything to
   say, it will spread out from them, and they can say it straight, and it
   will spread out from them and there will be no stopping it. And that's the
   essential fantasy. We're moving it all in here, into the Rat Shack."

   Into the Rat Shack

   Then Kesey's voice picks up and he starts assigning tasks: Page in charge
   of setting up a stage and chairs. Roy Seburn to decorate the place with a
   lot of cloth hangings. Faye and Gretch to get food and drink. Hermit to
   seal up all the holes in the walls. Zonk to draw up and post the guest
   list...

   The few!

   The fantasy is to compile an invitation list and contact them all, far and
   wide, now, this afternoon and tonight, by telephone, messenger, whatever
   it takes, and everybody starts thinking of those people close in enough to

   The whole freaking adventure

   to invite to this last roundup .. . What a thought! ...

   Do you remember

   all the Pranksters who have wandered far and wide, like June the Goon,
   Marge the Barge, Sensuous X, Anonymous, Norman Hartweg-

   "Hire an ambulance to bring him from Ann Arbor!" Christ, all the
   memories... the Perry Lane people ... Sandy Lehmann-Haupt-

   Because, nevertheless, he was there when

   the pudding whipped up creamy--

   "Hugh Romney!"

   "Bonnie Jean!"

   And Paul Sawyer and Rachel Rightbred ... and all the wild screwy people
   who got on the bus on the golden track wherever and whither-

   "Mary Microgram!"

   "That little guy who wrote the pot poem!"-and they write that down-

   "That guy with the ears, that weirdo!" says Babbs-and they write that
   down-

   "That couple in Portland!"-and they write that down-

   "That pretty Indian boy on Haight Street!"-and they write that down-

   "The Mad Chemist!"

   Yeah ! Oh shit, do you remember

   "Big Nig!"

   Gimme the rent

   "Culley!"

   "Owsley!"

   Survival

   "That guy in jail!"

   "The Who Cares Girl!"

   Ra-a-a-a-ay

   "Ray!"

   "Pancho Pillow!"

   "J. Edgar Hoover!"-and they write that down-

   See the very hunted coons

   "Gaylord!"

   "Jim Fish!"

   "Agent Number One!"

   !Maricones!

   Cosmo!

   Cos-mo

   Oh shit what a flow from eons ago in La Honda across the length and the
   breadth and the sleek and the Rat and it all comes flooding and bubbling
   back like a crest if they can just sit up on it and ride and ride and ride
   and ride here in the gloom and beat back those little crab lice in
   frogmen's suits six little neoprene rubber armlets for each little crab
   louse leg creeping about camouflaged like tiny scars in the brain the
   focking debacle infestation, the morose thought clumped somewhere in every
   brain until out through the starveling self-shuck fiesta euphoria Page
   brings it out front and out loud in the scabid sinkhole of the Warehouse,
   the ancient Shellube voice of please-don't-shit-me:

   "It's great to be a part of the greatest jackoff in history."

   NEVERTHEFREAKINGLESS! THE NEXT NIGHT, HALLOWEEN, the magic long-awaited
   hour ... I can hardly believe it, the Pranksters have transformed the
   place. You have to hand it to them, they must have worked like Turks. It's
   still a pestilence among buildings, you understand, this Warehouse, but
   there's verve in the air, Rat splendor. The most splendid thing is a huge
   orange-and-white parachute, an enormous thing, just the silk, not the
   strings and all, hooked to the ceiling at the apex, and billowed out to
   the far corners of the ceiling like some majestic canopy out of a Louis XV
   lawn revel in the Orangerie at Versailles. It glistens ! Grand luxe! The
   very same parachute, it turns out, that Astronauts use on reentry for the
   splashdown ... Hm-mmmm ... Yes... Quite a sight! The Pranksters have
   turned into the Flag People again, in their American Flag coveralls.
   Mountain Girl sits at the Sixth Street side in Flag coveralls checking
   guests against the invitation list which is posted up on the door in Paul
   Foster God Rotor script. Mountain Girl opens the Can't Bust 'Em coveralls
   and suckles Sunshine as the few, the faithful.. . the many! . . . come
   flapping by . . . Their faces are painted in Art Nouveau swirls, their
   Napoleon hats are painted, masks painted, hair dyed weird, embroidered
   Chinese pajamas, dresses made out of American flags, Flash Gordon
   diaphanous polyethylene, supermarket Saran Wrap, India-print coverlets
   shawls Cossack coats sleeveless fur coats piping frogging Bourbon hash
   embroidery serapes sarongs saris headbands bows batons vests frock coats
   clerical magisterial scholar's robes stripes strips flaps thongs Hookah
   boots harem boots Mexicali boots Durango boots elf boots Knight boots Mod
   boots Day-Glo Wellingtons Flagellation boots beads medallions amulets
   totems polished bones pigeon skulls bat skeletons frog thoraxes dog femurs
   lemur tibia kneecap of a coyote ... A hell of a circus, in short, a whole
   carnival banner, a panopticon. Hell's Angels pulling in, in their colors,
   the death's-head jackets, full dress, beards combed and trimmed, Terry the
   Tramp, Pete the Drag Racer, Ralph of Oakland, plus their girls...
   miniskirts and raspberry stockings. .. Chocolate George ... Chaos!
   Shitfire! Chocolate George doesn't see his name on the list and his girl
   keeps saying, "What's the matter, George, can't we get in?" until Mountain
   Girl gives a bullshit laugh and waves them in. A kid about ten pops out of
   the door onto Sixth Street and yells, "Who's smoking grass around
   here?"-in the most demanding voice you ever heard ... aggressive little
   devil. There's even a nursery set up inside the door and they keep making
   the Hermit stay the hell out of there. Kesey is off to one side in a Flag
   People coverall, looking around, not saying much, listening to a big Angel
   from Oakland who has on a polka-dot shirt and a polka-dot tie under his
   Angels' jacket-"I wore a shirt and tie, Ken, on account of it's
   Halloween"-rock 'n' roll playing over the loudspeakers, which are all over
   the place, on the sides, on the ceiling, right up in the summit of the
   parachute canopy even ... microphones, cameras, TV cameras... Yes ... The
   Few and the Faithful!-all the same, the word of the hoopla in the scabid
   old Warehouse is around town like a chic piece of information.
   Irresistible, of course ... Three TV stations have cameramen there, four
   radio stations with microphones and tape machines. Herbert Gold the
   novelist with an aftershave smile on. Ingrid Bergman's daughter, Pia
   Lindstrom ... Oh, sweet adrenal edge! This is where it's at! what-could
   this be... the new wave?... Where? in comes the Women's Wear Daily
   correspondent in San Francisco, Albert Morch, a brassy little character
   with a Rolleiflex around his neck ... Caterine Milinaire of Vogue with a
   miniature camera in a chain-mail evening purse, standing amid Angels,
   heads, and the Probation Generation like a Bulfinch princess . . . Larry
   Dietz the magazine writer from Los Angeles... And me ... Kesey looking
   around and saying nothing and . .. wondering . .. Hmmmmm ... The Few and
   the Faithful and the whole hulking world. It's a regular beano, all right.
   But, Mother! These costumes aren't for a Halloween party but for the
   liberation of dead souls... churchly vestiture, in truth ...

   Are we blind? ... Oblation ... Consecration ... Communion ... Well... The
   Anonymous Artists of America climbing up onto the stage ... They're like
   freaking faeries out of A Midsummer Night's Dream, dueling shirts and long
   gowns of phosphorescent pastels like the world never saw before, Day-Glo
   death masks beaming out in front of the instruments. The music suddenly
   submerges the room from a million speakers... a soprano tornado of it...
   all-electric, plus the Buchla electronic music machine screaming like a
   logical lunatic ...

   Out into the middle, under the great parachute canopy and the spotlights,
   sailing across the mungery carpet. . . Doris Delay of the Pranksters in
   Flag People coveralls and Terry the Tramp of Hell's Angels in an Ozark
   razorback stovepipe hat dark glasses Angel beard, a huge brown-and-black
   striped sweater like a raccoon, the Angels' sleeveless jacket and the
   death's head, blue jeans, motorcycle boots ... Christ, here's a coming-out
   party for you, Doris Delay and Terry the Tramp . .. stomping and flailing
   about in a regular hoedown ... but formal in a wacky way. They dance for
   about a minute and then the others rush out, a storm of them, couples in
   acid-head fancy dress, dancing to the rock 'n' roll, only they're dancing
   clean out of their gourds, they leap, they flail their arms up in the air,
   they throw their heads back, they gyrate and levitate ... they're in a
   state ... they're ecstatic ... Gary Goldhill looks on from the side. He
   has on a huge lake-red Chinese pajama top with a gold dragon embroidered
   on it. He's spooked about the Warehouse .. . Musty! . .. Insane! ...
   Friends or spirits? Well-Earth can be Heaven & Hell and he takes the
   plunge ... and reaches into his pants pocket and swallows a potion . ..

   Already a few enraptured grins breaking out in the crowd ... Rapt
   wet-lipped bliss... They glisten, their eyes are wide open like plastic
   nodules. The Telepathic Kid is so high, grinning so wet and glistening, he
   looks like one great psychic orgasm getting ready to unfold exfoliate into
   ... a calla lily ... and a blond kid with a white Nehru coat on and a big
   silver pendant hanging down over his chest kneeling before the rock 'n'
   roll band with his hands brought up like in prayer and a grin of such pure
   acid bliss on his face that his teeth sizzle ... a pot full of boiling
   pearls ... The Pranksters; Babbs and Gretch and Page and others, take to
   the bandstand, all electrified, and they start beaming out the most weird
   loud Chinese science-fiction music and cranking up the Buchla electronic
   music machine until it maneuvers itself into the most incalculable sonic
   corner, the last turn in the soldered circuit maze, and lets out a pure
   topologically measured scream. Ultima-time, with heavy-duty wiring, the
   works. Kesey stands off to one side still, in the shadows, at... Control
   Central, only now he has the Flag People coveralls off and is bare
   chested, wearing only white leotards, a white satin cape tied at the neck,
   and a red, white, and blue sash running diagonally across his chest. It's
   ... Captain America! The Flash! Captain Marvel! the Superhero, in a word
   ...

   At the height of the frenzy suddenly the lights go out, the sound goes
   out, all replaced by a single spotlight hitting the center of the floor.
   Kesey's brother Chuck is up in the rafters working the lights. You can
   hear Babbs's and Hassler's voices over microphones in the dark, rapping
   back and forth in a shuck manner: "Do you think they'd clear out of the
   center if we asked them, Hassler?" ... "Sure, they're gonna clear out the
   center faster than you can say clear out the center" ... But everyone just
   mills around, caught in the blackout. Babbs says: "If they don't clear out
   the center, then they're a bunch of assholes" ... Well, let's try the
   direct approach! They clear out of the ellipse where the spot beams down,
   and Kesey comes in out of the darkness. He's taken the cape and the sash
   off, however. Too freaking much, I guess. He's just wearing the white
   ballet tights and his wrestler's build. A pair of jockey shorts show
   faintly under the leotards-just the right touch ... here in the Rat Shack
   ... He has a hand microphone up to his mouth.... Kesey in the leotards
   with the pool of light in front of him and the heads all packed in around
   the loop of light in the darkness.... It's good and theatrical ... in a
   weird weird way ... Some of the heads get the point immediately. Without a
   sound, they start tossing things into the pool of light, sugar cubes,
   capsules, cigarette papers, a couple of joints, beads, amulets, headbands,
   all the charms and totems of psychedelphia into the pool of light. It's
   ... an altar ... Kesey starts talking over the microphone in the upcountry
   drawl...

   "When we were down in Mexico, we learned a lot about waves. We spent six
   months down there learning about waves. Even in the dark you can feel the
   waves..."

   It's a wrench, that voice, what is it? up to now-a party, a frenzy. All of
   a sudden it's on a whole other level... of some sort... we can't figure it
   out. The TV crews are trying to edge up close and jockey for position. Is
   this where he tells the kids to turn off LSD? ... Which is what-we came
   for... Waves?

   "I believe that man is changing ... in a radical basic way ... The waves
   are building, and every time they build, they're stronger. Our concept of
   reality is changing. It's been happening here in San Francisco ... I
   believe there's a whole new generation of kids. They walk different... I
   can hear it in the music ... It used to go ... life-death, life-death ...
   but now it's ... death-life . . . death-life

   The TV crewmen are trying to hand their microphones to heads near Kesey.
   They want them to hold them near him to pick up the words better. They
   implore the heads, they half order them in stage whispers. The heads are
   disgusted. They just stare at them. Kesey shoots a few whammies their way
   ... These bastards and their... positioning... they only want to use you
   for a little while ... They're punctures in the dirigible, flatulent
   murmurs in the heart, they're-the TV crews are pissed, too. Snotty
   dope-head kids! ... Coverage is a pain in the ass here in Edge City. Can't
   do with it, can't do without it-a grand hassle in the making-

   "... For a year we've been in the Garden of Eden. Acid opened the door to
   it. It was the Garden of Eden and Innocence and a ball. Acid opens that
   door and you enter and you stay awhile ..."

   At which precise point-mysteries of the synch! yes-four policemen great
   dark-blue figures come walking in through the door on the Sixth Street
   side. The word starts firing around the crowd in the dark: Cops! Cops! ...
   One last monster raid to finish off the debacle! There is a hell of a
   scurrying in the darkness, bodies hitting the walls of the garage, like
   gigantic fancy-dress rats looking for holes ... Get the hell out of here!
   ... It's the Probation Generation, of course, all the kids who are out on
   probation under firm admonition not to associate with known dope users...
   they're practically digging through the concrete floor ... The four
   policemen keep walking in at a slow gait, looking this way and that.
   Cassady is on a microphone way behind Kesey now, up on the stage, in fact,
   beginning to rap about the cops coming in: "Four custom-tailored
   constables, you understand, looking for pearl heads among the
   swineherds..."

   "The cops are here?" says Kesey. He sounds startled.

   "The constabulary cops ..."

   "They come in waves, too," says Kesey, "they're a pattern that repeats"
   ... Yah! ...

   By now the cops have just stopped on the edge of the crowd in the
   darkness, just looking around.

   "There's cops and there's policemen," Kesey says. "The cop says, 'Don't do
   that. That's forbidden and that's all there is to that.' The policeman
   says, 'You can do that, but if you go too far, you're going to hurt
   yourself The policeman is the double line in the middle of the road. I'm
   talking about inside of us."

   A spot suddenly comes on, hitting Cassady in a little cone of light. "It's
   like Ken once said," says Cassady. "If you ignore a cop for twenty years,
   then he's not there any more ..."

   "Haw!-Haw!-Haw!"-Hell's Angels in the corner-the four cops just survey the
   camp meeting, then start turning around to leave. Cassady keeps on
   rapping:

   "Yes! Violence, you understand .. . There's not going to be any violence
   here. If we wanted some violence we have some fellows here who could
   furnish it. .."

   "Haw!-Haw!-Yah!-Yagggggh!-A good cop is a dead cop!"

   "A good cop is a dead cop!"

   But the cops just walk on out, rocking at the same slow gait, brushing
   through a clump of Hell's Angels like they weren't there. The cops are
   gone, but they punctured the atmosphere again. Kesey tries to build it up,
   in the same soft tones, but it's tough going. He plunges in with the
   vision, the vision of Beyond

   Acid, how he saw the lines of light across the bay in Manzanillo, the line
   of grass . . .

   "... and I'd smoked some grass, some Acapulco Gold, as a matter of fact. .
   ."

   Cheers go up in the dark, Acapulco Gold! Oh shit we're esoteric heads and
   we know the creamiest of all the marijuana. But it's a freaking puncture.
   Kesey plunges through the whole vision: the line of acid, the circle
   demanding completion, the little lights across the bay ... It's
   metaphorical, allegorical, brains are getting messed up left and right...
   The rock 'n' roll, the frenzy, the TV cameras, the darkness, the cops, and
   now... this... It keeps ricocheting from level to level. Shit! what is
   Kesey... doing... Finally the line with the hook on it-completing the
   circle without going all the way. He's telling them the whole thing,
   but-what is . ..

   "We've been going through that door and staying awhile and then going back
   out through that same door. But until we start going that far . . . and
   then going beyond . . . we're not going to get anywhere, we're not going
   to experience anything new . .."

   They're uncomfortable, they're stuffing their shirts in and pulling them
   out, too many rips in the balloon, and brains messed up.. . and the
   freaking TV jackals stabbing microphones around like tape-recording the
   hanging of Lenny Bruce-

   "Let's find out where we are. Let's move it around. Let's dance on it."

   The lights come back on, the music starts back up, the color is back,
   everything starts spinning like a top again. Goldhill is zonked by now.
   The music flows through his neural ganglia like a flood of relief... Love!
   Bless, bless! bright lights! The Hell's Angels are stomping around again,
   everybody dancing. But that doesn't last long. Kesey is out in the middle
   of the crowd. People close in around him. The music stops. Kesey looks
   slightly glazed over but plunging on, like he is determined to seize the
   whole debacle by the shoulders and shake it into place. He has a chunk of
   ice. He kisses it, he puts a big chunk in his mouth, he breaks off a chunk
   and gives it to Cassady. Cassady kisses a chunk and then rubs it all over
   his bare chest. An ice thing ... The TV cameramen and radio reporters are
   trying to edge in. They're buffeted back. Everything is pitching and
   rolling. Kesey and Cassady are sitting on the floor communing over the
   ice. Pranksters and some other heads are getting into a circle on the
   floor with Kesey and Cassady ... the lotus position ... Gary Goldhill sits
   down with them. He's ready. The kid with the sizzling teeth sits down
   among them, zonked ... the lotus position ... His back is arched back
   stiff in the Nehru coat. He's rapt. The pot of pearls boils and boils.
   They all join hands and close their eyes-a communal circle ... They close
   their eyes tighter and tighter, waiting for... the energy. It's coming!
   It's coming! A high-pitched keening noise rises up from the circle ... Do
   you hear it! ... It's weird ... Half the people looking on are nonplused,
   they're embarrassed. What is this a Halloween party or a seance and the
   Holy Rollers? Christ... Albert Morch of Women's Wear Daily says to
   Caterine Millinaire: "Say! when! met you last night-I didn't know you were
   the Duke of Bedford's daughter!" ... Got religion! The Angels are
   restless. They're standing around the edge of the circle. "Hey! Start the
   music!" ... In the circle, Kesey, Cassady, and the rest-they're starting
   to rap back and forth. The kid with the boiling teeth hears the voice. His
   eyes are still tight shut. He grins and glistens. "A dead towhee," he
   says, "a rumpled road and a dead towhee." His voice is on the edge of
   delirium and tears ... or else any moment he is going to break into an
   insane cackling laugh... "A dead towhee and a rumpled road and lying in
   the dust, a mistake... a mistake, but it's not important... Making a
   mistake is not important... it's the context in which the mistake is made
   ... A rumpled road and a dead towhee and four gasoline stations, white and
   sterile, refueling tailfins in mid-air for fat men in sunglasses who do
   not see the rumpled road and the dead towhee ..."

   Goldhill sits rapt... Energy waves emanating from everywhere ... Like ...
   black spirits! ... Kesey & Cassady-what are they trying to do with his
   mind ... Got me, trapped me into the Big Wait-for what? an idea? a
   revelation? love? feeling? breakthrough-into what? or

   Put-on

   They're putting him on! Sucking him in! But-the idea we're waiting for-he
   can feel it, physically, it's surging through ... He looks deep down
   inside, to describe it.

   Presque vu!

   Mass daemonic hallucination it is! He looks around ... All pitches and
   rolls...

   A CIRCUS OR HELL

   The tortured and the damned are all around him, the dead-for-good souls
   ... He gets up radiating Chinese firecrackers from his dragon pajamas and
   heads for the Sixth Street door but... the Dead and the Damned! Faces!

   Hell's Angels

   Hell's Angels are packed into the corridor leading to the door ready for

   Massacre

   He turns back into the crowd, sinks into a time warp ... Like his life is
   an endless tape loop ... Black spirits keep bubbling up out of the most
   ancient pits of licorice detergent

   Trap

   That! Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare
   Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare and as he chants he becomes... Krishna! ...
   Christ! ... God ... And he pops out of the time warp into the silver haze
   of... The Universal Mind ...

   "We almost had it," says Kesey, opening his eyes for the first time. "We
   would have had it. There's too much noise ..." But it's like the cloud has
   passed.

   People are milling around, starting to leave. They're befuddled and
   embarrassed. What the hell kind of party ... The Angels are beginning to
   leave, the TV crews, Herbert Gold has had enough ... Albert Morch ... It's
   getting toward three o'clock ... People stare at the stage, but there's no
   sign of music. Is it over? Are you on the bus? ... in the pudding?

   Kesey plunges on. The lights go out again. The wrench is total now. It's a
   whole other .. . thing ... Kesey moves to the other side of the floor and
   sits down. The spot hits him. The Pranksters start gathering from all over
   the garage: Mountain Girl, The Hermit, Babbs, Gretch, Doris Delay, Page,
   The Hassler, Cassady, Black Maria, Zonker, Gut, George Walker, Ram Rod,
   Stewart Brand, Lois Jennings, all heading toward Kesey. Hassler has a hand
   mike and he starts saying in the dark:

   "Everybody who's with us, everybody who's with us in this thing, move in
   close. If you're not part of this thing, if you're not with us, then it's
   time to leave. You can move in close and get into this thing or you can
   leave, because ... that's what time it is..."

   Shitfire! that's it-those who were a little spooked by the turn the night
   is taking are now totally spooked. People heading for the Sixth Street
   door, flapping and burbling. The Pranksters, meantime, draw in close to
   Kesey, stepping by people, over people, then settling down, nestling in a
   circle around Kesey. Others pulling in, through the darkness, toward the
   cone of light lighting up Kesey's head and back. Kesey looks distraught.
   He looks up into the light. He has a hand mike. He makes a gesture as if
   to say, Let them through-

   "I know these people," he says. "I've been with these people!"

   The whole Allegory ... A tableau of the Plains of... The tightest inner
   circle is packed in around him, then the Prankster outer circle. Then a
   few of the old Perry Lane crowd. Then various heads who are deep into the
   pudding, like Goldhill and the Kid with the Boiling Teeth, then rings and
   rings, the grades of faith . . . plus a few clumps up against the wall, of
   people with no faith at all, just too stroked out or curious to leave.
   Finally Cassady stepping over the hunkered-down, lotused, sitting bodies,
   heading toward the inner circle ... Kesey looks up at him, then he seems
   to grow dizzy and sink ... His head rolls...

   "Goodbye, Neal!" he says. He looks like he might pass out. Cassady pulls
   closer. Kesey hunches over the microphone.

   "They're saying, 'Look at him-the promising novelist... once surrounded by
   thousands... and now only these few'... But I can-"

   -he drops the thought, however. The whole place is quiet and dark, just
   one small spotlight on Kesey ...

   "Get Faye and the kids." Silence. Then a rustle of Faye coming through the
   clump of people, leading the little girl, Shannon, and the oldest boy,
   Zane, and carrying the youngest, Jed. They've all been in the nursery
   section up by the Sixth Street door. One of them is crying, only it is
   like a scream. That's all you hear in here, it's eerie ... Faye and the
   kids and Mountain Girl and Sunshine and all the Pranksters in a tight
   circle with Kesey. They all hold hands and close their eyes. Silence. Then
   the scream again

   Archetypical! Mind Power!

   Then a voice from one of the clumps of people by the wall, some girl, with
   a spondee voice like a Ouija medium:

   "The-child-is-cry-ing-Do-some-thing-for-the- child-first-"

   Kesey says nothing. His eyes are shut tight. The high keening sound rises
   from the circle with the kid's scream weaving through it. Fantastic mind
   power crackle-Goldhill registers the energy

   They're almost

   But the girl on the other side doesn't let up: "See-a-bout-
   the-child-A-Child-is-cry-ing-That's-all-that's-
   hap-pening-A-child-is-cry-ing-and-no-one-is- do-ing-any-thing-a-bout- it-"

   Almost have it-presque vu!

   "-Why-is-the-child-cry-ing-Doesn't-an-y-bo-dy- care?-"

   Feel it! The vibration level!

   Kesey looks up. The spot hits him in the face. The Pranksters release
   hands. The music starts up. The Anonymous Artists of runenca play a rock
   'n' roll version of Pomp and Circumstance with drum flourishes...

   The Acid Test Graduation

   By now the crowd is down to about fifty. The lights come up a little
   around the stage, but the rest of the garage is dark. Cassady is up on the
   stage in front of a microphone. He has on nothing but a pair of khakis
   hung down on his hips and a mortarboard hat on his head, the kind you
   graduate in. In one hand he has a whole stack of diplomas. He's wound up
   like a motorcycle, kicking and twitching and ticking and jerking at the
   knees, the elbows, the head ... He's off on a dazzling run of words. The
   Anonymous Artists of America keep rolling away behind him. Every time the
   little blond girl on the drums gives the drums a good swat, Cassady
   stiffens, a spasmodic jerk, as if somebody just kicked him in the small of
   the back. He's rapping away, he's handing out the diplomas for the Acid
   Test Graduation. It's coming off after all... now ... when? what the hell
   time is it? Five o'clock in the morning or ... who the hell knows... Kesey
   is in the dimness sunk into the great easy chair. Some of the... graduates
   are here, Pranksters mainly. They put on black caps and gowns and come
   bouncing up to the stage and get a diploma from Cassady ... scrolly
   convoluted things done by Paul Foster and the God Rotor....

   Gut the Hell's Angel lets out a whoop and does a little dance as his name
   is called. Many of the graduates aren't there. The Who Cares Girl...

   "The Who Cares Girl," says Cassady. "Now, the Who Cares Girl couldn't be
   with us this evening, you understand, had to check in for choir practice
   in the oat bin two hundred fine voices tuned to a split hair screaming the
   name of the cowboy known as Ray, you understand, couldn't be with us
   either-ahem-lost in a Band-Aid factory swabbing the jake seats with A-200
   ..."

   ... and the drums roll and Cassady stiffens and jerks and twitches and the
   Pranksters hasten forward, Hassler, Babbs, Zonker, The Hermit, Mountain
   Girl, Gretch, Paul Foster, Black Maria, Page, Walker, Hagen, Doris Delay,
   Roy Seburn, flying up and back in black robes... graduate- into what on
   the horizon ... as the light of dawn breaks through the crack in the
   garage door behind the bandstand. Those cold goddamn silver slivers... and
   the light rises in the garage, a cockroach orange dimness, and there is
   perfect silence, the world stroked out this way and that as in ... Lucite
   . .. And the heat of the day creeps in, and rising out of the funk and the
   musk and the Rat grease smears-now come the cinches, mites, crab lice,
   fleas, fruit flies, grubs, weevils, all the microbes and larval ooze-and
   start writhing and crawling and festering and frying and wriggling and
   sizzling. The straight world breathes in, coughs, gags, spaghetti trapped
   in every glottis and flapping in panic ...

   Back among the acid heads of San Francisco there were two or three days of
   post mortems after the collapse of the Prankster Winterland fantasy and
   the strange night in the garage. A little breast-beating here and there
   ... Oh, did we give in to Fear and Doubts, which a good head cannot
   afford, and thereby stop a brave cat from doing his thing... But just as
   many said, Kesey was out to freak us out or cop out on us, and it was just
   as well. And then the communal mind, not willing to be anti-freak-out,
   settled on the cop-out theory of it. Kesey had been just copping out all
   along, to keep from going to jail. That settled something else, too, the
   troublesome... souped-up thing the Pranksters were always into, this
   400-horsepower takeoff game, this American flag-flying game, this Day-Glo
   game, this yea-saying game, this dread neon game, this... superhero game,
   all wired-up and wound up and amplified in the electropastel chrome game
   gleam. It wasn't the Buddha, not for a moment. Life is shit, said the
   Buddha, a duress of bad karmas, and satori is passive, just lying back and
   grooving and grokking on the Overmind and leave Teddy Roosevelt out of it.
   Grace is in a/far country, India by name .. . Oh, the art of living in
   India, brothers... And so what if there is no plumbing and the streets are
   dirty, they have mastered the art of living . . .

   The Pranksters had cleared all their debris out of the garage before the
   Calliope Company had moved back in, and they had piled it up in the vacant
   lot next door and then they headed off to Babbs's old place, the spread,
   in Santa Cruz. The Prankster debris lay there in the lot, a vast weird
   junkhead of bits and pieces of costumes and masks and pieces of wood with
   Day-Glo paint all over them and weird signs painted in Day-Glo on swaths
   of butcher paper and it lay there writhing like a maniac all day, and at
   night... it glowed ... A blot on the escutcheon of Harriet Street. The
   neighbors there, industrious Japanese and others, were disadvantaged
   souls, but they had their pride and they formed a delegation to City Hall
   to insist on keeping their neighborhood clean. The Mayor's Office saw it
   as an example of the kind of neighborhood pride that regenerates the City,
   for if they could instill the good burgher spirit in even so lowly a
   neighborhood as the Tenderloin ... So the Mayor announced utmost
   cooperation and it became a regular ceremony, with officials showing up
   along with the Sanitmen, and the TV crews. And the City pitched in,
   joining forces with the good neighbors of Harriet Street, in the
   ceremonial destruction of the weird junk heap-Christ only knew what insane
   degenerate wino generations had combined to nearly take over this poor
   forgotten street like jungle rot. The Day-Glo paint sputtered and sizzled
   to the end . ..

   The Calliope Company held an Acid Test in the garage, and Cassady,
   wheeling around San Francisco in his latest car, heard about it somehow
   and showed up that night. He came in the doorway on the Harriet Street
   side, now marked 69 Harriet Street, after the humor of the times, and he
   was jerking and kicking at top speed to the unseen Joe Cuba ... He was
   sailing on speed, as the thirty or forty heads there could tell by the way
   his eyes jumped around, going tic tac tok tok tok tak toc tac tok tik tik
   tik tik tik tac tok tac tok tik tik tik tik tik toc tac toc tac toc
   tac-either that or he was amazed at this Acid Test through and through.
   There were no lights except the slowest and most fluid light projections,
   no noise except the most mellifluous hi-fi playing. .. what the fock...
   sitar? sitar? sitar? ... The garage was scrubbed and chaste and pure with
   wall hangings of the most meticulous sort, India-print coverlets, delicate
   and intricate of pure vegetable macrobiotic dyes. A few crystals in the
   air picked up rays of light one by one like ... jewels... And all the good
   heads were stroked out most silently, propped up sitting against the walls
   or stretched out, each grooving on his own private inward thing,
   receptacles of the Buddha, the All-one invited guest, and the Buddha could
   have walked in at any moment and felt right at home, 485 b.c. or right
   now, the ...

   .. . dead-ass little gook ... Cassady can't believe it... He is rapping a
   mile a minute, but nobody picks him up on it. They just stare at him
   through great amethyst eyes, full of tolerance and pity as his own eyes
   sprocket and his shoulders bob and weave...

   "Hey ! Don't you want to do anything--get it started, you understand-slide
   it around-"

   They just stare at him, peaceful luminescent violet jewel children,
   smiling like a bunch of freaking nuns, full of peace and tolerance and
   pity ... as he turns around shaking his head and his shoulders and kicking
   and flailing disappearing out onto Harriet Street again.

   OH CHRIST ANOTHER LITTLE BUD IN THE HEAVES AND GASSES of the discovery
   pangs. Her eyes are opened up like morning-glories, her lips are wet and
   glistening, she smiles like an entranced nun, her teeth are beginning to
   sizzle ... hold on to the thoracic box. She has her face right up in
   yours, everybody's, and she is saying, ecstatic with the discovery-

   "I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-getting the picture! We're-all here-right? We're all
   here! We're-he-e-e-e-e-e-ere!" and her hand pans around to take in the
   Fantasia in-the-beginning cosmos... which is, in fact, only a place known
   as The Barn, in Scotts Valley, ten miles from Santa Cruz. The Barn is
   Scotts Valley's first psychedelic nightspot, a great barn, truly, once
   converted into a theater and now into a psychedelic nightspot run by Leon
   Taboory, Scotts Valley's first, and last, to hear the grousing from the
   church down the way and the local constables and townfolk and the local
   paper, but ne'mind all that. To the little girl it's her first glimpse of
   Heaven itself, zonked as she is on LSD, her first capsule-

   "I'm-getting the picture! We're all he-e-e-e-e-ere and we can do anything
   we want!"

   -revealing all this to Doris Delay and Zonker, Doris, like a good old
   helpful hand, says, "That's right. We're all here and everything's all
   right and you're fine."

   The little bud sinks into a folding chair beside Doris's and gives her a
   look. "I should be suspicious of you . .."

   "The paranoia stage," Doris says to Zonker. I love to tell the story-

   "... because I'm stoned."

   "I know," says Doris. To tell the old, old story-love and glory now
   playing in your neighborhood for the first run, in Scotts Valley ...

   About eighty of the local heads and hipfolk and jazz buffs, etc., in here
   listening to a jazz trio called The New Dimensions, Dave Molinari, Andrew
   Shushkoff, and a stocky little guy playing the bass. The little guy has on
   a sporty-type hat, wears it while he plays, his signature, you understand,
   and a pair of Cuban wrap-around sunglasses, although it is dark and
   appropriately nightclubby, except for some light projections, which makes
   it... psychedelic ... ah ummmmmm ... and he is kneading and slapping and
   flummoxing the bass like the creamy days of Siam Stewart. The New
   Dimensions-now that's very funny, you know. Ken Kesey and the Merry
   Pranksters have to smile over that. Kesey and the Pranksters are off to
   one side of the Barn waiting for their turn to go on, setting up their
   instruments, the electric guitars and basses, Gretch's Hammond organ,
   Walker's drums, and the goddamnedest gleaming heap of wires, dials,
   amplifiers, speakers, headsets, mikes-testing, testing-The New Dimensions.
   .. Yeah. The trio is like a throwback to the late 1940s and the early
   1950s when jazz was, like, the final form, funky and so fine. Molinari-or
   is it Shushkoff?-goes into a hell of a riff--Oh Christ, remember?-on the
   piano, with his head dug down deep into the profound soul funky depths of
   this thing. It's so . . . well, nostalgic . . . Scotts Valley troops into
   post-World War II hip America . . .

   The Pranksters have their own speakers set up all over the barn and Babbs
   is trying to test the microphones, watching for the needle to jump over
   the dials... Babbs has on his Day-Glo spirit mask and it glows in the
   dark, also a Shazam shirt and pants of many stripes and colors and he
   blows into the microphones, then hums a bit and watches the needles, then
   keens a bit, then croons a bit, and that's nice, so he tries a little
   ululation, and that's nicer, and pretty soon he is keening and gooning
   along with the New Dimensions and his voice sails through their sound like
   a stoned ghost on the airwaves. Kesey sits on a folding chair in the
   Control Center testing the headsets. Cassady has the Rat-tar, now painted
   an infinite number of colors and totally without strings. Doris Delay
   plays kindly aunt with the zonked-out little girl who's getting the
   picture . . .

   The New Dimensions finish their set and they're mad as hell, of course.
   What. . . cube was doing that screaming bit, f'r chrissake . . . The three
   of them come stomping up to the likely suspects, the Pranksters, led by
   the stocky guy with the hat and sunglasses. He walks up to Babbs and says,

   "Like, I mean, who's doing all that-"

   "Doing what?" says Babbs.

   "Like, later, man, don't give me the doing-what bit. You know doing-what,
   man. I mean like-"

   "Was somebody doing something?"

   "Like, I mean, that's... later! You know! I mean, it... grates!"

   "Oh, you mean that funny noise! I'd say feedback."

   "Sure! Feedback!"

   "Yeah! Yeah! Right! Right! Right!" Just a parlor sport, this is . . .
   fella could do it with his left hand. The little guy is furious. He tries
   to find the words to express his utter loathing.

   "Like, man, this fuck-up bit on somebody else's set-it's so - square!"

   There! he said it! the worst insult he knows! Next, the fire next
   time-Kesey steps in as the peacemaker: "He wasn't working against you-he
   was trying to play with you."

   The little guy stares at Kesey but doesn't say anything. He just screams
   it again into the void: "Like, it's so - square!"

   "Yeah! Yeah! Right! Right! Right!" says Babbs. "And there's the guy who
   did it!" and he points at Cool Breeze, who is sitting at a little table
   with a candle on it, hunched over a piece of paper, doing some kind of
   intense meth-like drawing. "There he goes!" says Cassady, picking up on
   the thing. "Takes a phantom heart to catch a Cool Breeze, you understand-"
   and so forth and so on, a shuck, in a word, never trust a Prankster ...
   And the New Dimensions walk off, disgusted ...

   They refuse to play any more and start packing up their instruments, which
   leaves Taboory, The Barn's manager, in a bind. He can't figure out who the
   hell to alienate. Kesey is a giant... on the other hand, the New
   Dimensions can play ... But too late for all that. The New Dimensions
   stomp out, thumbing their noses at the whole scene. The Pranksters wind up
   for their set. They clamp on their headsets. The headsets are wired up to
   a variable-lag system. So the Pranksters don't hear what they are playing
   right now but what they were playing a second ago. They harmonize off
   themselves, break up all learned progressions, and only they can hear the
   full... orchestration, a symphony in their cortices, the music of the
   Prankster ... ah ummmm ... Only the kids in The Barn, can't figure out
   what's going on... It's like, weird... The Pranksters put on their
   headsets and pick up their instruments, Kesey on an electric guitar, Page
   on an electric guitar, also Hassler, Babbs on an electric bass, Gretch on
   the electric organ, George Walker on the drums. They look all ready to go,
   but nothing happens. They're waiting ... for the... energy ... to build
   up, to come crackling over the headsets ... the spontaneous burst... but
   nothing works. Somebody starts and nobody else can pick it up and soon
   it's obvious that none of these crazy-looking people is going to play the
   instruments, except for the drummer .. . and they're not playing songs,
   they make it up as they go along . . . the leader, the muscular guy,
   Kesey, singing:

   "It's a .. . road map! .. . that ought to have been issued, about how to
   reach the edge of time ... on a horse who flies in tungsten red . .."

   And the guy in the mask on the bass singing: ". . . floods of screams on
   the beach in bomby raids of bloody rainbows ... It's dark and I lose my
   vision ..."

   Well... the kids start leaving ... what the hell...

   Babbs belches over a microphone. That gets a laugh. But is it art? Kesey
   barks like a dog. George Walker says over his microphone: "Where'd that
   dog go? I heard a... dog!... under my very feet!"

   They slough to a halt. Hassler starts chanting into his microphone, which
   is wired in only to the headsets... Only Pranksters can hear:

   "Begin it like we began ... at the beginning... Do it like we did... at
   the beginning ... In the beginning... in the beginning ..." Chanting over
   the inner space network.

   But the slump and the slough are total.. /The kids all going in droves now
   ... Just the Pranksters left... An atmosphere of total tedium ... It's ...
   all... too ... much ... for mortal-

   Even Pranksters drifting off... leaving the main floor, going
   downstairs... Hagen shakes his head. "It's like a wake .. ." It's that
   burnt-out husk of the dark hours of the morning ... Black Maria finds a
   mattress in a utility room and lies down .. .Cassady, not high at all-low,
   in fact-offers to drive a girl home ... Now it's just Kesey on the
   electric guitar and Babbs on the electric bass, them and their head-sets
   picking up the sound of their instruments and their song in variable lag .
   . . Taboory himself, the manager, can't take it any more ... "Just shut
   the door tight when you leave," he tells Kesey, and he takes off... All
   the lights are out now, just a little glow from the dials of Prankster
   Control Center ... Kesey and Babbs have their eyes closed, strumming
   slowly ... alone in the center of the vast gloom of the barn ... The whole
   world contracts, draws closer and deeper and crawls inside the headsets,
   ricocheting in variable lag in the small hours, and Kesey sings over his
   guitar, which twangs and wobbles:

   "... and every now and then you can hear her blowing smoke rings around a
   cloud and trying to lace up her shoe .. ."

   And Babbs: "... and the message goes out and it breaks out just a little
   bit but-stops-"

   And Kesey: "It's kind of hard, playing cello on a hypodermic needle and
   using a petrified bat as a bow ..."

   And Babbs: "Yes, it's hard working with these materials, without the grins
   falling off your knees . .."

   And Kesey: ".. . and the soldiers think of the lowly fleas..."

   And- "... the latrines wade back up around my knees..."

   "So let's set here in this dilapidated people hutch and think about the
   things we've done ..."

   "... Yes... down in Mississippi, that bitch girl we diddled in the cotton
   fields . . ."

   "Still. .. you want to catch the first subway to Heaven ..."

   "If I can get myself a new set of scales, I'll get my ass off this third
   rail.. . and so saying, he stood up and retched and looked down on the
   rail on sparks and long and hairy slavers of various flavors of dark
   intestinal brown ...".

   "... and his teeth fell out by the dozen and Hitler and his infested
   cousins began to grow in the cellar like a new hybrid corn and the crows
   wouldn't touch him ..."

   "... and up the rail, old True Blue wiped his nose on his uncle's clothes
   ..."

   "I took some pseulobin and one long diddle ..."

   "We blew it!"

   "... Ten thousand times or more ..."

   "We blew it!"

   ". .. so much we can't keep score ..."

   "We blew it!"

   "... just when you're beginning to think, 'I'm going to score'..."

   "We blew it!"

   ". . . but there's more in store .. ."

   "We blew it!"

   "... if we can get rid of these trading stamps that get in the way of the
   merchandise ..."

   "We blew it!"

   "... Ten million times or more! ..."

   "We blew it!"

   "... it was perfect, so what do you do? ..."

   "We blew it!"

   ". . . perfect! . . ."

   "We blew it!"

                                    Epilogue

   THREE WEEKS LATER, NOVEMBER 30, KESEY WENT ON TRIAL IN San Francisco for
   possession of marijuana-the bust on the rooftop. It ended with a hung
   jury, split 8 to 4 against him. Kesey's retrial, in April, ended with
   another hung jury, 11 to 1 against him this time. Rather than try him
   again, however, the state let him plead nolo contendere to a lesser
   charge, "knowingly being in a place where marijuana was kept." He got 90
   days. In May he lost in his appeal of the original San Mateo County
   conviction for possession of marijuana-the La Honda bust. The sentence was
   six months on a county work farm, a $1,500 fine and three years'
   probation. He was allowed to serve the other sentence, the 90 days,
   concurrently.

   Before he started serving time, Kesey took the bus and headed for his home
   town, Springfield, Oregon, with just Faye and the kids and Ram Rod on
   board. The Pranksters pretty much scattered. George Walker and Cassady
   were off in Mexico. Mountain Girl, with her baby, Sunshine, had already
   joined the Grateful Dead's group. Black Maria and Paul Foster went to the
   Hog Farm, Hugh Romney's commune near Los Angeles. Babbs and Gretch went to
   San Francisco. So did the Hermit...

   In June, Kesey began his stretch on the work farm, which was just a few
   miles from his old place in La Honda. He worked in the tailor shop. He was
   let out last November, after serving five months. He went back to Oregon,
   and he and Faye set up house in a shed on his brother Chuck's farm, up a
   gravel road south of Springfield. The shed was called the Space Heater
   House, after a gas heater inside that gave off a jet flame when it lit up.

   In February, Neal Cassady's body was found beside a railroad tract outside
   the town of San Miguel de Allende, in Mexico. Some local Americans said he
   had been going at top speed for two weeks and had headed off down the
   railroad track one night and his heart just gave out. Others said he had
   been despondent, and felt that he was growing old, and had been on a long
   downer and had made the mistake of drinking alcohol on top of
   barbiturates. His body was cremated.

   In the spring, various Pranksters. . . Babbs and Gretch, George Walker,
   Mike Hagen, Hassler, Black Maria ... began finding their way to Oregon
   from time to time. Kesey was writing again, working on a novel. The bus
   was there, parked beside the Space Heater House.

                                 Author's Note

   A NOTE ON THE WRITING OF THIS BOOK ... I HAVE TRIED NOT ONLY TO tell what
   the Pranksters did but to re-create the mental atmosphere or subjective
   reality of it. I don't think their adventure can be understood without
   that. All the events, details and dialogue I have recorded are either what
   I saw and heard myself or were told to me by people who were there
   themselves or were recorded on tapes or film or in writing. I was
   fortunate to get the help of many unusually talented and articulate
   people; most notably, Ken Kesey himself. The Pranksters recorded much of
   their own history in the Prankster Archives in the form of tapes, diaries,
   letters, photographs and the 40-hour movie of the bus trip. Kesey was also
   generous enough to allow me to draw from his letters to Larry McMurtry in
   the chapters on his flight to Mexico. Much of the dialogue and italicized
   material in Chapters XXI and XXIII is quoted from these letters.

   For all the Pranksters, as I have tried to show, the events described in
   this book were both a group adventure and a personal exploration. Many
   achieved great insight on both levels. I can think back especially to my
   talks with Mountain Girl, Hassler, Black Maria, Stewart Brand, Ken Babbs,
   Page Browning, Mike Hagen, Doris Delay, Hugh Romney, Zonker, George
   Walker, and Neal Cassady. Sandy Lehmann-Haupt told me about his Prankster
   days in especially full and penetrating detail.

   There were several excellent writers, in addition to Kesey, who were
   involved in the Prankster saga. Playwright Norman Hartweg recounted his
   experiences for me in a series of tapes. Ed McClanahan provided me with
   information about several phases of the Prankster adventure, and Robert
   Stone told me a great deal about Kesey's fugitive days in Mexico.

   Hunter Thompson made available to me several tapes he had made while
   working on his book. Hell's Angels, and parts of the book it self dealing
   with the Pranksters and the Angels were also helpful.

   I was also fortunate to find people like Clair Brush, who wrote for me a
   3,000-word description of her experience at the Watts Acid Test, much of
   which I quote in describing the Test. Of the many other people I talked to
   or corresponded with, I particularly want to mention Vic Lovell, Paul
   Sawyer, Paul Krassner, Pat Hallinan, Brian Rohan, Paul Robertson, Jerry
   Garcia, Gary Goldhill, Michael Bowen, Anne Severson, Paul Hawken, Bill
   Tara, Michael Laton, Jack the Fluke, Bill Graham, John Bartholomew Tucker,
   Roger Grimsby, Marshall Efron, Robin White, Larry McMurtry, Larry
   Schiller, Donovan Bess, Carl Lehmann-Haupt, and Mr. and Mrs. Fred Kesey.
