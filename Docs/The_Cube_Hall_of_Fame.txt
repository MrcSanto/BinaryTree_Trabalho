handcuffed and violated in every orifice by random strangers and their
pets.  Information wants to be bound and gagged and raped with a ski
pole. Information most certainly does NOT want to be free.

I used to have the ability, given a food sample, to determine exactly

I thought the goal was to keep it broken until people forget what a
real post looks like. The community will slowly evolve into a cargo
cult that keeps ritualistically checking for new messages, without the
slightest idea what a message looks like, or what it really
portends. Different groups will make such claims as, "A message will
appear, informing everyone that the messiah is coming," "A message
will appear heralding the end of the world," and "True believers
already see messages. See, there's one now.  It says that you suck."


Response:

It's all a distraction.  Intended to stop you from 
realizing that we're all just a bunch of chemicals and it doesn't
really make a difference if you walk into a crowded area with an uzi
and kill 40 people.
